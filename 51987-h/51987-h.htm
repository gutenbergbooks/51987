      CHAPTER I
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">W</span>HEN John Stuart
      Webster, mining engineer and kicker-up-of-dust on distant trails, flagged
      the S. P., L. A. &amp; S. L. Limited at a blistered board station in Death
      Valley, California, he had definitely resolved to do certain things. To
      begin, he would invade the dining car at the first call to dinner and
      order approximately twenty dollars' worth of ham and eggs, which
      provender is, as all who know will certify, the pinnacle of epicurean
      delight to an old sour-dough coming out of the wilderness with a healthy
      bankroll and a healthier appetite; for even as the hydrophobic dog avoids
      water, so does the adventurer of the Webster type avoid the weird
      concoctions of high-priced French chefs until he has first satisfied that
      void which yawns to receive ham and eggs.
    </p>
    <p>
      Following the ham and eggs, Mr. Webster planned to saturate himself from
      soul to vermiform appendix with nicotine, which he purposed obtaining from
      tobacco with nicotine in it. It was a week since he had smoked anything,
      and months since he had tasted anything with an odour even remotely like
      tobacco, for the August temperature in Death Valley is no respecter of
      moisture in any man or his tobacco. By reason of the fact that he had not
      always dwelt in Death Valley, however, John Stuart Webster knew the
      dining-car steward would have in the ice chest some wonderful cigars,
      wonderfully preserved.
    </p>
    <p>
      Webster realized that, having sampled civilization thus far, his debauch
      would be at an end until he reached Salt Lake City-unless, indeed, he
      should find aboard the train something fit to read or somebody worth
      talking to. Upon arrival in Salt Lake City, however, his spree would
      really begin. Immediately upon leaving the train he would proceed to a
      clothing shop and purchase a twenty-five-dollar ready-to-wear suit,
      together with the appurtenances thereunto pertaining or in any wise
      belonging. These habiliments he would wear just long enough to shop in
      respectably and without attracting the attention of the passing throng;
      and when later his &ldquo;tailor-mades&rdquo; and sundry other finery
      should be delivered, he would send the store clothes to one Ubehebe Henry,
      a prospector down in the Mojave country, who would appreciate them and
      wear them when he came to town in the fall to get drunk.
    </p>
    <p>
      Having arranged for the delivery of his temporary attire at the best hotel
      in town, Webster designed chartering a taxicab and proceeding forthwith to
      that hotel, where he would engage a sunny room with a bath, fill the
      bathtub, climb blithely in and soak for two hours at least, for it was
      nearly eight months since he had had a regular bath and he purposed making
      the most of his opportunity. His long-drawn ablutions at length over, he
      would don a silken dressing gown and slippers, order up a barber, and
      proceed to part with enough hair and whiskers to upholster an automobile;
      and upon the completion of his tonsorial adventures he would encase his
      person in a suit of mauve-coloured silk pajamas, climb into bed and stay
      there for forty-eight hours, merely waking long enough to take another
      bath, order up periodical consignments of ham and eggs and, incidentally,
      make certain that a friendly side-winder or chuck-walla hadn't
      crawled under the blankets with him.
    </p>
    <p>
      So much for John Stuart Webster's plans. Now for the gentleman
      himself. No one&mdash;not even the Pullman porter, shrewd judge of mankind
      that he was&mdash;could have discerned in the chrysalis that flagged the
      Limited the butterfly of fashion that was to be. As the ebony George
      raised the vestibule platform, opened the car door and looked out, he had
      no confidence in the lean, sun-baked big man standing by the train.
      Plainly the fellow was not a first-class passenger but a wandering
      prospector, for he was dog-dirty, a ruin of rags and hairy as a tarantula.
      The only clean thing about him was a heavy-calibred automatic pistol of
      the army type, swinging at his hip.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Day coach an' tourist up in front,&rdquo; the knight of the
      whiskbroom announced in disapproving tones and started to close down the
      platform.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So I perceived,&rdquo; John Stuart Webster replied blandly. &ldquo;I
      also observed that you failed to employ the title <i>sir</i> when
      addressing a white man. Put that platform back and hop out here with your
      little stool, you saddle-coloured son of Senegambia, or I'll make
      you a hard porter to catch.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yassah, yassah!&rdquo; the porter sputtered, and obeyed instantly.
      Mr. Webster handed him a disreputable-looking suitcase and stepped aboard
      in state, only to be informed by the sleeping-car conductor that there
      wasn't a vacant first-class berth on the train.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I know I'm dirty,&rdquo; the late arrival announced
      cheerfully, &ldquo;but still, as Bobby Burns once remarked, 'a man's
      a man for a' that'&mdash;and I'm <i>not</i> unsanitary.
      I sloshed around some in Furnace Creek the night before last, and while of
      course I got the top layer off, still, a fellow can't accomplish a
      great deal without hot water, soap, a good scrubbing-brush and a can of
      lye.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm very sorry,&rdquo; the conductor replied perfunctorily
      and endeavoured to pass on, but Webster secured a firm grip on his lapel
      and frustrated the escape.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You're not sorry,&rdquo; the ragged wanderer declared,
      &ldquo;not one little bit. You're only apprehensive. However, you
      needn't be. There is no wild life on me, brother, I assure you. If
      you can prove it, I'll give you a thousand-dollar bill for each and
      every bit of testimony you can adduce.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I tell you, the train is full up. You'll have to roost in
      the daycoach or the tourist. I'm very sorry&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So am I, for I know what daycoaches and tourist-cars smell like in
      the middle of August, because, as the poet says, I've been there
      many a time and oft.' Nevertheless, despite your deep grief,
      something tells me you're spoofing, so while I must, of necessity,
      accept your suggestion, said acceptance will be but temporary. In about
      two hours, young fellow, you're going to make the alarming discovery
      that you have bats in your belfry.&rdquo; And with a whiskery grin which,
      under the circumstances, was charming in its absolute freedom from malice,
      Mr. Webster departed for the daycoach.
    </p>
    <p>
      Two hours later the conductor found him in the aforementioned daycoach,
      engaged in a mild game of poker with a mule-skinner, a Chinaman, an aged
      prospector, and a half-breed Indian, and waited until Mr. Webster, on a
      bob-tailed club flush, bluffed the Chinaman out of a dollar-and-a-half
      pot.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Maud, Lily, and Kate!&rdquo; Webster murmured, as the Celestial
      laid down three queens and watched his ragged opponent rake in the pot.
      &ldquo;Had I held those three queens and had you made a two-card draw as I
      did, only death could have stopped me from seeing what you held! Hello!
      Here's Little Boy Blue again. All right, son. Blow your horn.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you Mr. John S. Webster?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your assumption that I am that person is so eminently correct that
      it would be a waste of time for me to dispute it,&rdquo; Webster replied
      quizzically. &ldquo;However, just to prove that you're not the only
      clairvoyant on this train, I'm going to tell <i>you</i> something
      about <i>yourself</i>. In your pocket you have a telegram; it is from
      Chicago, where your pay-check originates; it is a short, sweet, and
      comprehensive, containing an order which you are going to obey. It reads
      somewhat as follows:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'My friend, John S. Webster, wires me from Blank that he
      boarded train at Blank and was refused first-class accommodation because
      he looked like a hobo. Give him the best you have in stock, if you have to
      throw somebody off the train to accommodate him. Unless you see your way
      clear to heed this suggestion your resignation is not only in order but
      has already been accepted.' Signed, 'Sweeney.'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do I hit the target?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The conductor nodded. &ldquo;You win, Mr. Webster,&rdquo; he admitted.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Occasionally I lose, old-timer. Well?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who the devil is Sweeney?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      John Stuart Webster turned to his cosmopolitan comrades of the national
      game. &ldquo;Listen to him,&rdquo; he entreated them. &ldquo;He has worked
      for the company, lo, these many years, and he doesn't know who
      Sweeney is?&rdquo; He eyed the conductor severely. &ldquo;Sweeney,&rdquo;
      he declared, &ldquo;is the man who is responsible for the whichness of the
      why-for. Ignorance of the man higher up excuses no sleeping-car conductor,
      and if your job is gone when you reach Salt Lake, old-timer, don't
      blame it on me, but rather on your distressing propensity to ask foolish
      questions. <i>Vamos, amigo</i>, and leave me to my despair. Can't
      you see I'm happy here?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No offense, Mr. Webster, no offense. I can let you have a stateroom&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's trading talk. I'll take it.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The conductor gave him his receipt and led him back to the stateroom in
      the observation-car. At the door Webster handed him a five-dollar bill.
      &ldquo;For you, son,&rdquo; he said gently, &ldquo;just to take the sting
      out of what I'm about to tell you. Now that I possess your receipt
      and know that ten men and a boy cannot take it away from me, I'm
      going to tell you who Sweeney is.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who is he?&rdquo; the conductor queried. Already he suspected he
      had been outgeneralled.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sweeney,&rdquo; said Mr. Webster, &ldquo;is the chief clerk in one
      of Chicago's most pretentious hotels and a young man who can find
      all the angles of a situation without working it out in logarithms. I
      wired him the details of my predicament; he heard the Macedonian cry and
      kicked in. Neat, is it not?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The conductor grinned. &ldquo;I hate to take your money,&rdquo; he
      declared.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don't. Just at present I'm very flush. Yes, sir, I'm
      as prosperous as a yearling burro up to his ears in alfalfa, and the only
      use I have ever found for money is to make other people happy with it,
      thereby getting some enjoyment out of it myself. Just as soon as I get a
      little chunk together, some smarter man than I takes it all away from me
      again&mdash;so the cleaning process might just as well start here. When I'm
      broke I'll make some more.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By remembering that all a man needs in this world, in order to
      excel, is about two per cent, more courage than a jack-rabbit; also that
      an ounce of promotion in a world of boobs is worth a ton of perspiration.
      Thank you for falling for my bluff.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      And having wotted the which, Mr. Webster retired to his hard-won
      sanctuary, where he removed as much alkali and perspiration as he could,
      carded his long hair and whiskers, manicured his finger nails with a
      jack-knife, changed his shirt, provided five minutes of industry for
      George, with his whiskbroom and brush, and set himself patiently to await
      the first call to dinner.
    </p>
    <p>
      The better to hear the dinner call Webster left his stateroom door open,
      and presently a pink-jowled, well-curried, flashily dressed big man, of
      about Webster's age, passed in the corridor, going toward the head
      of the train. An instant later a woman's voice said very distinctly:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do not know you, sir; I do not wish to know you, and it is
      loathsome of you to persist in addressing me. If you do not stop your
      annoying attentions, I shall call the conductor.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! Beauty in distress,&rdquo; John Stuart Webster soliloquized.
      &ldquo;I look so much like an Angora goat I might as well butt in.&rdquo;
      He stepped to the door of his stateroom. A girl stood in the vestibule,
      confronting the man who had just passed Webster's door. Webster
      bowed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Madame, or mademoiselle, as the case may be,&rdquo; he said,
      &ldquo;unlike this other male biped, my sole purpose in presuming to
      address you is to suggest that there is not the slightest necessity for
      taking this matter up with the conductor. I am here and very much at your
      service.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The girl turned&mdash;and John Stuart Webster's heart flopped twice
      in rapid succession, like a trout newly grassed. She was as lovely as a
      royal flush. Her starry glance began at his miner's boots, travelled
      up his old, soiled, whipcord trousers, over his light blue chambray shirt
      and found the man behind the whiskers. She favoured him with a quick,
      curious scrutiny and a grave, sweet smile. &ldquo;Thank you so much, sir,&rdquo;
      she answered, and passed down the corridor to the observation-car.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, old-timer,&rdquo; Webster greeted the fellow who had been
      annoying her, &ldquo;how about you? What do you think we ought to do about
      this little affair?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The sensible thing would be to do&mdash;nothing.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You might start something you couldn't finish.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's a dare,&rdquo; Webster declared brightly, &ldquo;and
      wasn't it the immortal <i>Huckleberry Finn</i> who remarked that
      anybody that'd take a dare would suck eggs and steal sheep?&rdquo;
      He caressed his beard meditatively. &ldquo;They say the good Lord made man
      to His own image and likeness. I take it those were only the
      specifications for the building complete&mdash;the painting and interior
      decorating, not to mention the furnishings, being let to a sub-contractor.&rdquo;
      He was silent a few seconds, appraising his man. &ldquo;I suppose you
      commenced operations by moving into her section and asking if she would
      like to have the window open and enjoy the fresh air. Of course if she had
      wanted the window open, she would have called the porter. She rebuffed
      you, but being a persistent devil, you followed her into the
      observation-car, and in all probability you ogled her at luncheon and
      ruined her appetite. And just now, when you met her in this vestibule, you
      doubtless jostled her, begged her pardon and without waiting to be
      introduced asked her to have dinner with you this evening.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well?&rdquo; the fellow echoed belligerently.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's all bad form. You shouldn't try to make a mash on
      a lady. I don't know who she is, of course, but she's not
      common; she's travelling without a chaperon, I take it, and for the
      sake of the mother that bore me I always respect and protect a good woman
      and whale hell out of those that do not.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He reached inside his stateroom and pressed the bell. The porter arrived
      on the run.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;George,&rdquo; said Mr. Webster, &ldquo;in a few minutes we're
      due at Smithville. If my memory serves me aright, we stop five minutes for
      water and orders.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yassah.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Remain right here and let me off as soon as the train comes to a
      stop.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      When the train slid to a grinding halt and the porter opened the car door,
      Webster pointed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Out!&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;This is no nice place to pull off a
      scrap.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;See here, neighbour, I don't want to have any trouble with
      you&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know it. All the same, you're going to have it&mdash;or
      come with me to that young lady and beg her pardon.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      There are some things in this world which the most craven of men will not
      do&mdash;and the vanity of that masher forbade acceptance of Webster's
      alternative. He preferred to fight, but&mdash;he did not purpose being
      thrashed. He resolved on strategy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All right. I'll apologize,&rdquo; he declared, and started
      forward as if to pass Webster in the vestibule, on his way to the
      observation-car, whither the subject of his annoying attentions had gone.
      Two steps brought him within striking distance of his enemy, and before
      Webster could dodge, a sizzling righthanded blow landed on his jaw and set
      him back on his haunches in the vestibule.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was almost a knockout&mdash;almost, but not quite. As Webster's
      body struck the floor the big automatic came out of the holster; swinging
      in a weak circle, it covered the other.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That was a daisy,&rdquo; Webster mumbled. &ldquo;If you move before
      my head clears, I'll put four bullets into you before you reach the
      corridor.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He waited about a minute; then with the gun he pointed to the car door,
      and the masher stepped out. Webster handed the porter his gun and
      followed; two minutes later he returned, dragging his assailant by the
      collar. Up the steps he jerked the big battered hulk and tossed it in the
      corner of the vestibule, just as the girl came through the car, making for
      the diner up ahead.
    </p>
    <p>
      Again she favoured him with that calm, grave, yet vitally interested gaze,
      nodded appreciatively, made as if to pass on, changed her mind, and said
      very gravely: &ldquo;You are&mdash;a very courtly gentleman, sir.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He bowed. There was nothing else to do, nothing that he could say, under
      the circumstances; to use his chivalry as a wedge to open an acquaintance
      never occurred to him&mdash;but his whiskers did occur to him. Hastily he
      backed into his stateroom and closed the door; presently he rose and
      surveyed himself critically in the small mirror over the washstand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, Johnny,&rdquo; he murmured, &ldquo;we can't go into the
      diner now. We're too blamed disreputable. We were bad enough before
      that big swine hung the shanty on our right eye, but whatever our physical
      and personal feelings, far be it from us to parade our iridescent orb in
      public. Besides, one look at that queen is enough to do us for the
      remainder of our natural life, and a second look, minus a proper
      introduction, would only drive us into a suicide's grave. That's
      a fair sample of our luck, Johnny. It rains duck soup&mdash;and we're
      there like a Chinaman&mdash;with chopsticks; and on the only day in the
      history of the human race, here I am with a marvellous black eye, a
      dislocated thumb, four skinned knuckles, and a grouch, while otherwise
      looking like a cross between <i>Rip Van Winkle</i> and a hired man.&rdquo;
      He sighed, rang for the porter and told him to send a waiter for his
      order, since he would fain break his fast in the privacy of his stateroom.
      And when the waiter came for the order, such was Mr. Webster's
      mental perturbation that ham and eggs were furthest from his thoughts. He
      ordered a steak with French fried potatoes.

      CHAPTER II
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">J</span>OHN STUART WEBSTER
      passed a restless night. Sleep came to him in hourly installments, from
      which he would rouse to ask himself whether it was worth while to continue
      to go through the motions of living, or alight at the next station, seek a
      lonely and unfrequented spot and there surrender to outrageous fortune. He
      had <i>lived</i> every moment of his life; fair fortune and ill had been
      his portion so often that he had long since ceased to care which took
      precedence over the other; to quote Mr. Kipling, he had schooled himself
      to &ldquo;treat those two impostors both the same&rdquo;&mdash;not a very
      difficult task, if one be granted a breathing spell between the arrival of
      each impostor! Hitherto, in Webster's experience, there had always
      been a decent interval between the two&mdash;say a day, a week, a month or
      more; whereas in the present instance, two minutes had sufficed to make
      the journey from a heaven of contentment to the dungeons of despair.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was altogether damnable. In a careless moment, Fate had accorded him a
      glimpse of the only woman he had ever met and desired to meet again&mdash;for
      Webster was essentially a man's man, and his profession and
      environment had militated against his opportunities for meeting
      extraordinary women; and extraordinary women were the only kind that could
      hope to challenge his serious attention. Had his luck changed there, he
      might have rested content with his lot&mdash;but it hadn't. Fate had
      gone farther. She had accorded him a signal opportunity for knightly
      combat in the service of this extraordinary woman; and in the absence of a
      formal introduction, what man could desire a finer opportunity for getting
      acquainted! If only their meeting had but been delayed two weeks, ten
      days, a week! Once free of his ugly cocoon of rags and whiskers, the
      butterfly Webster would not have hesitated one brief instant to inform
      himself of that young lady's name and address, following his summary
      disposal of her tormentor. Trusting to the mingled respect and confusion
      in his manner, and to her own womanly intuition to warn her that no
      rudeness or brazen familiarity was intended, he would have presented
      himself before her and addressed her in these words:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A few minutes ago, Miss, you were gracious enough to accord me the
      rare pleasure of being of slight service to you. May I presume on that
      evidence of your generosity and perfect understanding to risk a seeming
      impertinence by presuming to address you?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Webster pictured her as bowing, favouring him with that grave yet
      interested scrutiny and saying: &ldquo;Certainly, sir.&rdquo; Whereupon he
      would say:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It has occurred to me&mdash;for, like <i>Bimi</i>, the orangoutang,
      I have perhaps too much ego in my cosmos&mdash;that you might be
      charitably moved to admit me to the happy circle of those privileged to
      call you by name. Were there a mutual friend on this train whom I could
      prevail upon to introduce me formally, I should not be reduced to the
      necessity of being unconventional. Under the circumstances, however, I am
      daring enough to presume that this misfortune is not so great that I
      should permit it to interfere with my respectful desires. Therefore&mdash;have
      I your permission to present myself, with the hope that in so doing I <i>may</i>
      feel freer to be of additional service to you throughout the remainder of
      our journey?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      That would be a pretty, a graceful speech&mdash;a little ornate,
      doubtless, but diplomatic in the extreme. Having been accorded permission
      to introduce himself, he would cease thereafter to be flowery. However,
      Webster realized that however graceful might be his speech and bearing,
      should he essay the great adventure in the morning, his appearance would
      render him ridiculous and presumptuous and perhaps shock and humiliate
      her; for in all things there is a limit, and John Stuart Webster's
      right eye constituted a deadline beyond which, as a gentleman, he dared
      not venture; so with a heavy heart he bowed to the inevitable. Brilliant
      and mysterious as a meteorite she had flashed once across his horizon and
      was gone.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the privacy of his stateroom Webster had ham and eggs for breakfast. He
      was lighting his second cigar when the porter knocked and entered with an
      envelope.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Lady in the observation-car asked me to deliver this to you, sah,&rdquo;
      he announced importantly.
    </p>
    <p>
      It 'was a note, freshly written on the train stationery. Webster
      read:
    </p>
    <p>
      The distressed lady desires to thank the gentleman in stateroom A for his
      chivalry of yesterday. She quite realizes that the gentleman's offer
      to relieve her of the annoyance to which she was being subjected was such
      a direct expression of his nature and code, that to have declined his aid
      would have been discourteous, despite her distress at the possible
      outcome. She is delighted to know that her confidence in the ability of
      her champion has been fully justified by a swift and sweeping victory, but
      profoundly sorry that in her service the gentleman in stateroom A was so
      unfortunate as to acquire a red eye with blue trimmings.
    </p>
    <p>
      John Stuart Webster swore his mightiest oath, &ldquo;By the twelve
      apostles, Simon Peter, Andrew, James, John, Philip, Bartholomew, Matthew,
      Thomas, James, Jude, and Simon, not omitting Judas Iscariot, the scaly
      scoundrel who betrayed his Lord and Master!&rdquo; He searched through an
      old wallet until he discovered a fairly clean professional card, across
      the bottom of which he wrote, &ldquo;Thank you. J. S.W.&rdquo; and sent it
      to the no-longer-distressed lady.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The most signal adventure of my life is now over,&rdquo; he
      soliloquized and turned to his cigar. &ldquo;For the sake of my
      self-respect, I had to let her know I'm not a hobo! And now to the
      task of framing up a scheme for future acquaintance. I must learn her name
      and destination; so as a preliminary I'll interview the train
      conductor.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He did, and under the ameliorating influence of a five-dollar bill the
      conductor bent a respectful ear to the Websterian message.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In Car Seven,&rdquo; he began, &ldquo;there is a young lady. I do
      not know what section she occupies; neither do I know her name and
      destination. I only know what she looks like.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The conductor nodded. &ldquo;And you want to ascertain her name and
      destination?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Easiest thing in life. There is only one young lady in Car Seven. I
      suppose you mean that queen with the olive complexion, the green suit, and&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hold! Enough.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All right. I have the unused portion of her transportation to
      return to her before we hit Salt Lake; her name is on the ticket, and the
      ticket indicates her destination. I'll make a mental note of both as
      soon as I've identified her ticket.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;After you've made the said mental note,&rdquo; Webster
      pleaded, &ldquo;be sure you write it down, so you'll not forget.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      A few hours later the conductor came to Webster's stateroom and
      handed him a card upon which was written:
    </p>
    <p>
      Dolores Ruey. From Los Angeles, via San Pedro, Los Angeles &amp; Salt
      Lake, to Salt Lake City, Denver &amp; Rio Grande to Denver, Burlington to
      St. Louis, Illinois Central to New Orleans. Stop-over at Denver.
    </p>
    <p>
      John Stuart Webster studied the name after the conductor withdrew. &ldquo;That's
      a Spanish name,&rdquo; he soliloquized, &ldquo;but for all that, she's
      not a parakeet. There's something Gaelic about her features,
      particularly her eyes. They're brown, with golden flecks in them,
      and if she had a drop of dark blood in her, they'd be smoky and
      languid. Also if she were a Latin she would have referred to my black eye&mdash;whereas
      she referred to, a red eye with blue trimmings! Same thing but different!
      All things considered, I guess I'll take a chance and investigate.&rdquo;

    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">W</span>EBSTER'S
      dreams of bliss had, with very slight variation, come true as per
      schedule.
    </p>
    <p>
      In Salt Lake City he abandoned the beefsteak on his damaged eye for two
      businesslike leeches, which quickly reduced the nocturne effect around his
      orb, enabling him, the third day, to saunter forth among his fellowmen. By
      the end of the week he was a being reincarnated, and so he packed a huge
      new wardrobe-trunk with his latest purchases and journeyed on to Denver.
      Coincident with his arrival there, we again take up the thread of our
      story.
    </p>
    <p>
      One hour after his trunk arrived the gentleman from Death Valley might
      have been observed standing before a cheval glass looking long and
      earnestly at the reflection of his middle-aged person, the while he marked
      the fit of his new raiment.
    </p>
    <p>
      Let us describe these habiliments, alleging as an excuse for dwelling with
      emphasis upon the subject the fact that John Stuart Webster was all
      dressed up for the first time in three long, labour-ridden years, and was
      tremendously glad of it. Hark to this inventory. There were the silken
      hose and underwear next his well-scrubbed skin; then there was the white
      pleated linen shirt&mdash;a shirt so expensive and exquisite that Mr.
      Webster longed to go somewhere and shoot a game of billiards, in order
      that thus he might have an excuse to remove his coat and exhibit that
      shirt to the gaze of the multitude. His collar irked him slightly, but he
      had been assured by the clerk who sold it to him &ldquo;that it was
      strictly in vogue.&rdquo; His gray silk Ascot tie was held in a graceful
      puff by a scarfpin with a head of perfect crystal prettily shot with
      virgin gold; his black afternoon coat enveloped his wide shoulders and
      flanked his powerful neck with the perfection of the epidermis on a goose
      in the pink of condition; his gray striped trousers broke exactly right
      over his new &ldquo;patent leather&rdquo; shoes. The <i>tout ensemble</i>,
      as the gentleman himself might have expressed it had he possessed a
      working knowledge of French (which he did not), was perfect.
    </p>
    <p>
      He &ldquo;shot&rdquo; his cuffs and strutted backward and forward,
      striving to observe his spinal column over his right shoulder, for he was
      in a transport of delight as truly juvenile as that on the
      never-to-be-forgotten day when he had attained to the dignity of his first
      pair of long trousers. He observed to himself that it was truly
      remarkable, the metamorphosis nine tailors and a talkative barber can make
      in an old sour-dough.
    </p>
    <p>
      Presently, convinced that he was the glass of fashion and the mould of
      form, Mr. Webster took up a smart lancewood stick and a pair of new gray
      suede gloves and descended to the lobby of Denver's most exclusive
      hotel. He paused at the cigar stand long enough to fill his case with
      three-for-a-half perfectos and permit the young woman in charge to feast
      her world-weary eyes on his radiant person (which she did, classifying and
      tabulating him instantly as a millionaire mining man from Nevada). After
      this he lighted a cigar and stepped forth into Seventeenth Street, along
      which he strolled until he came to a certain building into the elevator of
      which he entered and was whisked to the twelfth floor, where he alighted
      and found himself before a wide portal which bore in gold letters the
      words: Engineers' Club.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Engineers' Club was the closest approach to a home that John
      Stuart Webster had known for twenty years, and so he paused just within
      the entrance to perform the time-honoured ceremonial of home-coming. Over
      the arched doorway leading to the lounge hung a large bronze gong such as
      is used in mines, and from the lever of the gong-clapper depended a cord
      which Webster seized and jerked thrice&mdash;thus striking the signal
      known to all of the mining fraternity&mdash;the signal to hoist! Only
      those members who had been sojourning in distant parts six months or more
      were privileged thus to disturb the peace and dignity of the Engineers'
      Club, the same privilege, by the way, carrying with it the obligation of
      paying for the materials shortly to be hoisted!
    </p>
    <p>
      Having announced the return of a prodigal, our hero stepped to the door of
      the lounge and shouted:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;John Stuart Webster, E. M.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The room was empty. Not a single member was present to greet the wanderer
      and accept of his invitation!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Home was never like this when I was a boy,&rdquo; he complained to
      the servant at the telephone exchange. &ldquo;Times must be pretty good in
      the mining game in Colorado when everybody has a job that keeps him out of
      Denver.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The servant rose and essayed a raid on his hat and stick, but Mr. Webster,
      who was impatient at thus finding himself amidst old scenes, fended him
      away and said &ldquo;Shoo fly!&rdquo; Then he crossed the empty lounge and
      ascended the stairs leading to the card room, at the entrance of which he
      paused, leaning on his stick&mdash;in unconscious imitation of a Sicilian
      gentleman posing for his photograph after his first payday in America&mdash;swept
      that room with a wistful eye and sighed because nothing had changed in
      three long years.
    </p>
    <p>
      Save for the slight job of kalsomining which Father Time had done on the
      edges of the close-cropped Websterian moustache, the returned prodigal
      might have stepped out of the Club but yesterday. He would not have taken
      the short end of a modest bet that even a fresh log had been placed on the
      fire or that the domino-players over against the wall had won or lost a
      drink or two and then resumed playing&mdash;although perchance there <i>were</i>
      a few more gray hairs in the thickly thatched head of old Neddy Jerome,
      sitting in his favourite seat by the window and turning the cards in his
      eternal game of solitaire, in blissful ignorance that John Stuart Webster
      stood within the portals of home and awaited the fatted calf.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'll hypnotize the old pelican into looking up,&rdquo;
      Webster soliloquized, and forthwith bent a beetling gaze upon the player.
      For as many as five seconds he strove to demonstrate the superiority of
      mind over solitaire; then, despairing of success, he struck the upholstery
      of an adjacent chair a terrific blow with his stick&mdash;the effect of
      which was to cause everybody in the room to start and to conceal Mr.
      Webster momentarily in a cloud of dust, the while in a bellowing baritone
      he sang:
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      His father was a hard-rock miner;
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      He comes from my home town&mdash;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Jack Webster! The devil's own kin!&rdquo; shouted Neddy
      Jerome. He swept the cards into a heap and waddled across the room to meet
      this latest assailant of the peace and dignity of the Engineers'
      Club. &ldquo;You old, worthless, ornery, no-good son of a lizard! I've
      never been so glad to see a man that didn't owe me money.&rdquo; He
      seized Webster's hand in both of his and wrung it affectionately.
      &ldquo;Jack,&rdquo; he continued, &ldquo;I've been combing the whole
      civilized world for you, for a month, at least. Where the devil <i>have</i>
      you been?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      John Stuart Webster beamed happily upon his friend. &ldquo;Well, Neddy,
      you old stocking-knitter,&rdquo; he replied quizzically, &ldquo;since that
      is the case, I'm not surprised at your failure to find me. You've
      known me long enough to have remembered to confine your search to the <i>uncivilized</i>
      reaches.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, you're here, at any rate, and I'm happy. Now you'll
      settle down.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hardly, Neddy. I'm young yet, you know&mdash;only forty.
      Still a real live man and not quite ready to degenerate into a
      card-playing, eat-drink-and-be-merry, die-of-inanition, sink-to-oblivion,
      and go-to-hell fireplace spirit!&rdquo; And he prodded Jerome in the short
      ribs with a tentative thumb that caused the old man to wince. He turned to
      greet the halfdozen card-players who had looked up at his noisy entrance&mdash;deciding
      that since they were strangers to him they were mere half-baked young
      whelps but lately graduated from some school of mines&mdash;and permitted
      his friend to drag him downstairs to the deserted lounge, where Jerome
      paused in the middle of the room and renewed his query:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Johnny, where have you been?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Lead me to a seat, O thou of little manners,&rdquo; Webster
      retorted. &ldquo;Here, boy! Remove my property and guard it well. I will
      stay and disport myself.&rdquo; And he suffered himself to be dispossessed
      of his hat, gloves, and stick. &ldquo;It used to be the custom here,&rdquo;
      he resumed, addressing Jerome, &ldquo;that when one of the Old Guard
      returned, he was obliged to ask his friends to indicate their poison&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where have you been, I ask?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Out in Death Valley, California, trying to pry loose a fortune.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did you pry it?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      John Stuart Webster arched his eyebrows in mock reproach. &ldquo;And you
      can see my new suit, Neddy, my sixteen-dollar, made-to-order shoes, and my
      horny hoofs encased in silken hose&mdash;and ask that question? Freshly
      shaved and ironed and almost afraid to sit down and get wrinkles in my
      trousers! Smell that!&rdquo; He blew a cloud of cigar smoke into Jerome's
      smiling face. The latter sniffed. &ldquo;It smells expensive,&rdquo; he
      replied.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, and you can bet it tastes expensive, too,&rdquo; Webster
      answered, handing his cigar-case to his friend&mdash;who helped himself
      and said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So you've made your pile, eh, Jack?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you suppose I would have come back to Colorado without money?
      Haven't you lived long enough, Neddy, to realize that when a man has
      money he never knows where to go to spend it? It's so blamed hard to
      make up one's mind, with all the world to choose from, and so the
      only place I could think of was the old Engineers' Club in Denver.
      There, at least, I knew I would find one man of my acquaintance&mdash;an
      old granny named Neddy Jerome. Yes, Neddy, I knew I would find you playing
      solitaire, with your old heart beating about seven times an hour, your
      feet good and warm, and a touch of misery around your liver from lack of
      exercise.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Jerome bit the end of his cigar and spat derisively. &ldquo;How much have
      you made?&rdquo; he demanded bluntly, &ldquo;It's none of your
      business, but I'll tell you because I love you, Neddy. I've
      made one hundred thousand dollars.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Chicken-feed,&rdquo; Jerome retorted.
    </p>
    <p>
      Webster glanced around. &ldquo;I thought at first nothing had changed in
      the old place,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;but I see I was mistaken.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, what's wrong, Jack?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, when I was here before, they used to ask a man if he had a
      mouth&mdash;and now they ask him how much money he's made, where he
      made it, and&mdash;why, hello, Mose, you black old scoundrel, how do you
      do? Glad to see you. Take the order, Mose: some milk and vichy for Mr.
      Jerome, and a&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yassuh, yassuh,&rdquo; Mose interrupted, &ldquo;an' a Stinger
      for you, suh.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Gone but not forgotten,&rdquo; breathed Mr. Webster, and walled his
      eyes piously after the fashion of one about to say grace before a meal.
      &ldquo;How sweet a thing is life with a club servant like old black Mose,
      who does things without an order. I feel at home&mdash;at last.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Johnny,&rdquo; Jerome began again, &ldquo;I've been combing
      the mineral belt of North and South America for you for a month.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why this sudden belated interest in me?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have a fine job for you, John&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;King's X,&rdquo; Webster interrupted, and showed both hands
      with the fingers crossed. &ldquo;No plotting against my peace and comfort,
      Neddy. Haven't I told you I'm all dressed up for the first
      time in three years, that I have money in my pocket and more in bank? Man,
      I'm going to tread the primrose path for a year before I get back
      into the harness again.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Jerome waved a deprecatory hand, figuratively brushing aside such feeble
      and inconsequential argument. &ldquo;Are you foot-loose?&rdquo; he
      demanded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm not. I'm bound in golden chains&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Married, eh? Great Scott, I might have guessed it. So you're
      on your honeymoon, eh?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No such luck, you vichy-drinking iconoclast. If you had ever gotten
      far enough from this club during the past fifteen years to get a breath of
      real fresh air, you'd understand why I want to enjoy civilization
      for a week or two before I go back to a mine superintendent's cabin
      on some bleak hill. No, sir-ee. Old Jeremiah Q. Work and I have had a
      falling out. I'm going on to New York and attend the opera, see all
      the good plays, mush around through the Metropolitan Museum of Art, drink
      tea, and learn to tango.&rdquo; Webster sighed gustily. &ldquo;Lord,
      Neddy, how I long for the fleshpots. I've slept under the desert
      stars so long I want electric signs for a change. Bacon and beans and sour
      dough are wonderful when one hasn't something better, but I crave an
      omelette soufflé drenched in cognac, and the cognac afire. Yes, and I want
      an obsequious waiter to hurry in with it and then take a dollar tip from
      me afterward for all the world like he was doing me a favour by accepting
      it. Dad burn your picture, Neddy, I want some class! I've been
      listening to a dago shift-boss playing the accordeon for three years&mdash;and
      he could only play three tunes. Now I want Sousa's band. I want to
      hive up in a swell hotel and leave a call for six o'clock&mdash;and
      then when they call me, I want to curse them, roll over, and go to sleep
      again. I've been bathing in tepid, dirty water in a redwood
      sluice-box, and now I desire a steam room and a needle shower and an
      osteopath. I've been bossing Greasers and Italians and was forced to
      learn their language to get results, and now I want to speak my mother
      tongue to my old friends. The last funny story I heard had whiskers on it
      when Rameses was playing hop-scotch in Memphis, Egypt, and by thunder I'm
      going to have a new deal all around.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very well, Jack. Don't excite yourself. I'll give you
      exactly thirty days to sicken of it all&mdash;and then I shall come and
      claim my property.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Neddy, I'll not work for you.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, yes, you will, John.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, sir, I'm mad. I won't play.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You're it. I just tagged you.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I require a rest&mdash;but unfold your proposition, Neddy. I was
      born a poor, weak vessel consumed with a curiosity that was ever my
      undoing. I can only protest that this is no way to treat a friend.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nonsense! My own brother wants this job, and I have refused to give
      it to him. Business is business&mdash;and I've saved it for you.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Jerome leaned forward and laid his finger confidentially on Webster's
      knee; whereat the lighthearted wanderer carefully lifted the finger,
      brushed an imaginary speck of dirt from it, and set it down again. &ldquo;Be
      serious, you ingrate,&rdquo; Jerome protested. ''Listen! I've
      been working for two years on a consolidation up near Telluride, and I've
      just put it across. Jack, it's the biggest thing in the country&mdash;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      Webster closed his eyes and crooned:
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      &ldquo;I'm dying for some one to love me;
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      I'm tired of living alone;
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      I want to be somebody's darling,
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      To be queen upon somebody's throne.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, you'll be king on the throne of the Colorado
      Consolidated Mines Company, Limited. English capital, Jack. Pay 'em
      6 per cent, and they'll call you blessed. There's twenty-five
      thousand a year in it, with a house and a good cook and an automobile and
      a chauffeur, and you can come to town whenever you please, provided you
      don't neglect the company's interests&mdash;and I know you're
      not that kind of an engineer.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do I have to put some money into it, Neddy?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not necessarily, although I should advise it. I can let you in on
      the ground floor for that hundred thousand of yours, guarantee you a
      handsome profit and in all probability a big clean-up.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I feel myself slipping, Neddy. Nevertheless, the tail goes with the
      hide. I'm not in the habit of asking my friends to guarantee my
      investments, and if you say it's all right, I'll spread what I
      have left of the hundred thousand when I report for duty. What's the
      news around this mortuary, anyhow? Who's dead and who's alive?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's been a tremendous job getting this consolidation over,
      Jack. When&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In pity's name! Spare me. I've heard all I want to hear
      about your confounded consolidation. News! News! Give me news! I had to
      beg for a drink&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I might remind you that your manners have not improved with age,
      Jack Webster. You haven't thanked me for that job.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No&mdash;nor shall I. Mose, you black sinner, how dare you appear
      before me again without that stinger?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Mose, the aged coloured porter of the Engineers' Club, flashed a row
      of ivories and respectfully re-turned the democratic greeting.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Letter for you, suh. The secretary told me to give it to you,
      Mistah Webster.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank you, Mose. Speak up, Neddy, and tell me something. Ever hear
      anything of Billy Geary?&rdquo; He was tearing the edge of the envelope
      the while he gazed at Jerome, who was rubbing his fat hands together after
      the fashion of elderly men who are well pleased with themselves.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have a chance to become one of the greatest and richest mining
      engineers in the world, Jack,&rdquo; he answered, &ldquo;now that you've
      cut loose from that young crook Geary. I don't know what's
      become of him, and neither does anybody else. For that matter, nobody
      cares.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do&mdash;and you can take the brief end of that bet for your last
      white chip. Don't let me hear you or anybody else say anything
      against Billy Geary. That boy goes for my money, every turn in the box.
      Don't make any mistakes about that, old-timer.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Webster's face suddenly was serious; the bantering intonation in his
      voice was gone, and a new, slightly strident note had crept into it. But
      Jerome, engrossed in his own affairs, failed to observe the menace in that
      swift transition of mood in his companion. He waved his hand soothingly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All right, old Johnny Pepper-box, have it your own way.
      Nevertheless, I'm a little mystified. The last I knew of you two,
      you had testified against him in the high-grader trials at Cripple Creek,
      and he had pulled out under a cloud, even after his acquittal.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Give a dog a bad name, and it will stick to him,&rdquo; Webster
      retorted. &ldquo;Of course I testified against him. As engineer for the
      Mine Owners' Association, I had to. The high-grade ore was found in
      his assay office, and the circumstantial evidence was complete, and I
      admit Billy was acquitted merely because I and others could not swear
      positively that the ore came from any certain mine. It was the same old
      story, Neddy. It's become history in all mining camps. You can be
      morally certain that high-grade ore has been stolen from your mine, but
      unless you catch the ore thief in the act, how can you prove it?
      High-grade ore is blind goods and is not confined to any certain man-owned
      spot on this wicked earth&mdash;so there you are! I suppose you read the
      newspaper reports and believed them, just as everybody else does.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, forget it, Jack. It's all over long ago, and forgotten.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It wasn't all over so long ago as you seem to think. I
      suppose you knew the Holman gang was afterward sent to the penitentiary
      for those same high-grade operations?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I'll bet my new plug hat you never knew I was the <i>Hawkshaw</i>
      that sent them there! You bet I was! Billy Geary's acquittal didn't
      end my interest in the case&mdash;not by a jugful! I fought the case
      against the friends of the Holman crew <i>among the mine owners themselves</i>;
      and it cost me my good job, my prestige as a mining engineer, and thirty
      thousand dollars of money that I'd slaved to get together. They
      squeezed me, Neddy&mdash;squeezed me hard like a lemon, and threw me away,
      but I got them! I should tell a man! Of course you never knew this, Neddy,
      and for that matter, neither does Geary. I wish he did. We were good
      friends once. I certainly was mighty fond of that boy.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He drew the letter from the envelope and slowly opened it, his mind not
      upon the letter, but upon Billy Geary.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you never heard what became of Geary?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not a word. I was too busy wondering what was to become of me. I
      couldn't get a job anywhere in Colorado, and I moved to Nevada. Made
      a million in Goldfield, dropped it in the panic of 1907, and had to start
      again&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What have you been doing lately?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Borax. Staked a group of claims down in Death Valley. Bully ground,
      Neddy, and I was busted when I located them. Had to borrow money to pay
      the filing fees and incorporation, and did my own assessment work. Look!&rdquo;
      Webster held up his hands, still somewhat grimy and calloused.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How did you get by with your bluff?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In the only way anybody ever got by on no pair. I was a brave dog
      and went around with an erect tail, talking in millions and buying my
      tobacco on jawbone. The Borax Trust knew I was busted, but they never
      could quite get over the fear that I'd dig up some blacking and give
      them a run&mdash;so they bought me out. Two weeks ago I got a belated
      telegram, telling me there was a hundred thousand dollars in escrow
      against deeds and certificate of title in a Salt Lake City bank&mdash;so
      here I am.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Somebody told me Geary had gone to Rhodesia,&rdquo; Jerome
      continued musingly, &ldquo;or maybe it was Capetown. I know he was seen
      somewhere in South Africa.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He left the Creek immediately after the conclusion of his trial.
      Poor boy! That dirty business destroyed the lad and made a tramp of him, I
      guess. I tell you, Neddy, no two men ever lived who came nearer to loving
      each other than Billy Geary and his old Jack-pardner. We bucked the marts
      of men and went to sleep together hungry many a time during our five-year
      partnership. Why, Bill was like my own boy! Do you know, Neddy, now that I've
      rounded the forty-pole, I get thinking sometimes, and wish I could have
      married when I was about twenty years old; I might have had a son to knock
      around with now, while I'm still in the shank of my own youth. And
      if I had been blessed with a son, I would have wanted him to be just like
      Billy. You know, Bill tied onto me when he was about eighteen. He's
      rising twenty-six now. He came to me at the Bonnie Claire mine fresh from
      high school, and I staked him to a drill; but he didn't stick there
      long. I saw he was too good a boy to be a mucker all his days.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Webster smiled reminiscently and went on: &ldquo;I'll never forget
      the day Billy challenged a big Cornish shift-boss that called him out of
      his name. The Cousin Jack could fight, too, but Billy walked around him
      like a cooper around a barrel, and when he finished, I fired the Cousin
      Jack and gave Billy his job!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He chuckled softly at the remembrance. &ldquo;Too bad!&rdquo; he
      continued. &ldquo;That boy had brains and grit and honour, and he shouldn't
      have held that trial against me. But Billy was young, I suppose, and he
      just couldn't understand my position. It takes the hard old years to
      impart common sense to a man, and I suppose Billy couldn't
      understand why I had to be true to my salt. He should have known I hadn't
      a leg to stand on when I took the stand for the prosecution&mdash;not a
      scintilla of evidence to present, except that the high-grade had been
      found in his assay office. Jerome, I curse the day I took that boy out
      from underground and put him in the Bonnie Claire assay office to learn
      the business. How could I know that the Holman gang had cached the stuff
      in his shack?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, it's too bad,&rdquo; Jerome answered dully. He was
      quite willing that the subject of conversation should be changed. &ldquo;I'm
      glad to get the right dope on the boy, anyhow. We might be able to hand
      him a good job to make up for the injustice. Have another drink?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not until I read this letter. Now, who the dickens knew I was
      headed for Denver and the Engineers' Club? I didn't tell a
      soul, and I only arrived this morning.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He turned to the last page to ascertain the identity of his correspondent,
      and his facial expression ran the gamut from surprise to a joy that was
      good to see.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a long letter, and John Stuart Webster read it deliberately. When
      he had read it once, he reread it; after which he sat in silent
      contemplation of the design of the carpet for fully a minute before
      reaching for the bell. A servant responded immediately.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bring me the time-tables of all roads leading to New Orleans,&rdquo;
      he ordered, &ldquo;&mdash;also a cable blank.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Webster had reread the letter before the servant returned with the
      time-tables. He glanced through them. &ldquo;Henry,&rdquo; he announced,
      &ldquo;your name is Henry, isn't it?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, sir&mdash;George, sir.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, August, you go out to the desk, like a good fellow, and ask
      the secretary to arrange for a compartment for me to New Orleans on the
      Gulf States Limited, leaving at ten o'clock to-morrow night.&rdquo;
      He handed the servant his card. &ldquo;Now wait a minute until I write
      something.&rdquo; He seized the cable blank, helped himself, uninvited, to
      Neddy Jerome's fountain pen, and wrote:
    </p>
    <p>
      William H. Geary,
    </p>
    <p>
      Calle de Concordia No. 19,
    </p>
    <p>
      Buenaventura,
    </p>
    <p>
      Sobrante, C. A.
    </p>
    <p>
      Salute, you young jackass! Just received your letter. Cabling thousand for
      emergency roll first thing to-morrow. Will order machinery. Leaving for
      New Orleans to-morrow night, to arrive Buenaventura first steamer. Your
      letter caught me with a hundred thousand. We cut it two ways and take our
      chances. Keep a light in the window for your old Jack Pardner.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's a windy cablegram,&rdquo; Neddy Jerome remarked as the
      servant bore it away. &ldquo;Why all this garrulity? A cablegram anywhere
      generally costs at least a dollar a word.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'That's my delight of a shiny night, in the season of
      the year,'&rdquo; quoted John Stuart Webster; &ldquo;and why the
      devil economize when the boy needs cheering up?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What boy?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Billy Geary.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Broke?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should say so. Rattles when he walks.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where is he?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Central America.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Neddy Jerome was happy. He was in an expansive mood, for he had, with the
      assistance of a kindly fate, rounded up the one engineer in all the world
      whom he needed to take charge of the Colorado Consolidated. So he said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, Jack, just to celebrate the discovery of your old pal, I'll
      tell you what I'll do. I'll O. K. your voucher for the expense
      of bringing young Geary back to the U. S. A., and when we get him here, it
      will be up to you to find a snug berth for him with Colorado Consolidated.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Neddy,&rdquo; said John Stuart Webster, &ldquo;by my hali-dom, I
      love thee. You're a thoughtful, kindly old stick-in-the-mud, but&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No <i>ifs</i> or <i>but's</i>. I'm your boss,&rdquo;
      Jerome interrupted, and waddled away to telephone the head waiter at his
      favourite restaurant to reserve a table for two.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Webster sighed. He disliked exceedingly to disappoint old Neddy, but&mdash;&mdash;
      He shrank from seeming to think over-well of himself by declining a
      twenty-five-thousand-dollar-a-year job with the biggest mining company in
      Colorado, but&mdash;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Rotten luck,&rdquo; he soliloquized. &ldquo;It runs that way for a
      while, and then it changes, and gets worse!&rdquo;

      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">W</span>HEN Jerome
      returned to his seat, the serious look in Webster's hitherto
      laughing eyes challenged his immediate attention. &ldquo;Now what's
      gone and broken loose?&rdquo; he demanded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Neddy,&rdquo; said John Stuart Webster gently, &ldquo;do you
      remember my crossing my fingers and saying, 'King's X'
      when you came at me with that proposition of yours?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. But I noticed you uncrossed them mighty quick when I told you
      the details of the job. You'll never be offered another like it.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know, Neddy, I know. It just breaks my heart to have to decline
      it, but the fact of the matter is, I think you'd better give that
      job to your brother after all. At any rate, I'm not going to take
      it.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why?&rdquo; the amazed Jerome demanded. &ldquo;Johnny, you're
      crazy in the head. Of course you'll take it.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      For answer Webster handed his friend the letter he had just received.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Read that, old horse, and see if you can't work up a
      circulation,&rdquo; he suggested.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jerome adjusted his spectacles and read:
    </p>
    <p>
      Calle de Concordia 19, Buenaventura,
    </p>
    <p>
      Sobrante, C. A.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dear John:
    </p>
    <p>
      I would address you as &ldquo;dear friend John,&rdquo; did I but possess
      sufficient courage. In my heart of hearts you are still that, but after
      three years of silence, due to my stupidity and hardness of heart, it is,
      perhaps, better to make haste slowly.
    </p>
    <p>
      To begin, I should like to be forgiven, on the broad general grounds that
      I am most almighty sorry for what I went and done! Am I forgiven? I seem
      to see your friendly old face and hear you answer &ldquo;Aye,&rdquo; and
      with this load off my chest at last I believe I feel better already.
    </p>
    <p>
      I did not know until very recently what had become of you, and that that
      wretched Cripple Creek business had been cleared up at last. I met a
      steam-shovel man a month or two ago on the Canal. He used to be a
      machine-man in the Portland mine, and he told me the whole story.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jack, you poor, deluded old piece of white meat, do you think for a moment
      that I held against you your testimony for the operators in Cripple Creek?
      You will never know how badly it broke me up when that Canal digger sprung
      his story of how you went the limit for my measly reputation after I had
      quit the company in disgrace. Still, it was not that which hurt me
      particularly. I thought you believed the charges and that you testified in
      a firm belief that I was the guilty man, as all of the circumstantial
      evidence seemed to indicate. I thought this for three long, meagre years,
      old friend, and I'm sorry. After that, I suppose there isn't
      any need for me to say more, except that you are an old fool for not
      saying you were going to spend your money and your time and reputation
      trying to put my halo back on straight! I doubt if I was worth it, and you
      knew that; but let it pass, for we have other fish to fry.
    </p>
    <p>
      The nubbin of the matter is this: There is only one good gold mine left in
      this weary world&mdash;and I have it. It's the sweetest wildcat
      lever struck, and we stand the finest show in the world of starving to
      death if we tackle it without sufficient capital to go through. (You will
      notice that I am already&mdash;and unconsciously&mdash;employing the
      plural pronoun. How rapidly the old habits return with the old friendships
      rehabilitated!) It will take at least thirty thousand dollars, and we
      ought to have double that to play safe. I do not know whether you have, or
      can raise, sixty cents, but at any rate I am going to put the buck up to
      you and you can take a look.
    </p>
    <p>
      Here are the specifications. Read them carefully and then see if there is
      anybody in the U. S. A. whom you can interest to the tune mentioned above.
      We could probably get by with thirty thousand, but I would not jeopardize
      anybody's money by tackling it with less.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jack, I have a mining concession. It is low-grade&mdash;a free-milling
      gold vein&mdash;twelve feet of ore between good solid walls on a contact
      between Andesite and Silurian limestone. The ore is oxidized, and we can
      save ninety per cent, of the values on amalgamating plates without
      concentrating or cyaniding machinery. I have had my own portable assay
      outfit on the ground for a month, and you can take my opinion for what it
      is worth when I assure you that this concession is a winner, providing the
      money is forthcoming with which to handle it.
    </p>
    <p>
      This is a pretty fair country, Jack&mdash;if you survive long enough to
      get used to it. At first you think it's Paradise; then you grow to
      hate it and know it for hell with the lid off; and finally all your early
      love for it returns and you become what I am now&mdash;a tropical tramp!
      There is only one social stratum lower than mine, and that's the
      tropical beachcomber. I am not that&mdash;yet; and will not be if my
      landlady will continue to listen to my blandishments. She is a sweet soul,
      with a divine disposition, and I am duly grateful.
    </p>
    <p>
      I would tell you all about the geography, topography, flora and fauna of
      Sobrante, but you can ascertain that in detail by consulting any standard
      encyclopedia. Governmentally the country is similar to its sister
      republics. The poor we have always with us; also a first-class,
      colorado-maduro despot in the political saddle, and it's a cold day
      indeed when two patriots, two viva's and a couple of old Long Tom
      Springfield rifles cannot upset the Sobrante apple cart. We have the usual
      Governmental extravagance in the matter of statues to countless departed
      &ldquo;liberators&rdquo; in all the public squares, and money is no
      object. It is depreciated shin-plasters, and I had to use a discarded
      sugar-barrel to hold mine when I arrived and changed four hundred pesos
      oro into the national currency. If a waiter brings you a jolt of hooch,
      you're stingy if you tip him less than a Sobrante dollar.
    </p>
    <p>
      We have a Malicon along the bay shore and back again, with a municipal
      bandstand in the middle thereof, upon which the fine city band of
      Buenaventura plays nightly those languid Spanish melodies that must have
      descended to us from the Inquisition. If you can spare the cash, send me a
      bale of the latest New York rags and a banjo, and I'll start
      something. I have nothing else to do until I hear from you, save shake
      dice at The Frenchman's with the Présidente, who has nothing else to
      do except lap up highballs and wait for the next drawing of the lottery. I
      asked him for a job to tide me over temporarily, and he offered me a
      portfolia! I could have been Minister of Finance!
    </p>
    <p>
      I declined, from a constitutional inability, inherent in the Irish, to
      assimilate a joke from a member of an inferior race.
    </p>
    <p>
      We haven't had a revolution for nearly six months, but we have
      hopes.
    </p>
    <p>
      There are some white men here, neither better nor worse. We tolerate each
      other.
    </p>
    <p>
      I am addressing you at the Engineers' Club, in the hope that my
      letter may reach you there, or perhaps the secretary will know your
      address and forward it to you. If you are foot-loose and still entertain a
      lingering regard for your old pal, get busy on this mining concession P.
      D. Q. Time is the essence of the contract, because I am holding on to the
      thin edge of nothing, and if we have a change of government I may lose
      even that. I need you, John Stuart Webster, worse than I need salvation. I
      enclose you a list of equipment required.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you receive this letter and can do anything for me, please cable. If
      you cannot, please cable anyway. It is needless for me to state that the
      terms of division are as you make them, although I think fifty-fifty would
      place us both on Easy Street for the rest of our days. Do let me hear from
      you, Jack, if only to tell me the old <i>entente cordiale</i> still
      exists. I know now that I was considerable of a heedless pup a few years
      ago and overlooked my hand quite regularly, but now that I have a good
      thing I do not know of anybody with whom I care to share it except your
      own genial self. Please let me hear from you.
    </p>
    <p>
      Affectionately,
    </p>
    <p>
      Billy.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jerome finished reading this remarkable communication; then with infinite
      amusement he regarded John Stuart Webster over the tops of his glasses as
      one who examines a new and interesting species of bug.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So Billy loves that dear Sobrante, eh?&rdquo; he said with abysmal
      sarcasm. &ldquo;Jack Webster, listen to a sane man and be guided
      accordingly. I was in this same little Buenaventura once. I was there for
      three days, and I wouldn't have been there three minutes if I could
      have caught a steamer out sooner. Of all the miserable, squalid,
      worthless, ornery, stinking holes on the face of God's green
      footstool, Sobrante is the worst&mdash;if one may judge it by its capital
      city. Jack, there is an old bromide that describes aptly the republic of
      Sobrante, and it's so trite I hesitate to repeat it&mdash;but I
      will, for your benefit. Sobrante is a country where the flowers are
      without fragrance, the men without honour, and the women without virtue.
      It is hot and unhealthy, and the mosquitoes wear breechclouts; and when
      they bite you, you die. You get mail three times a month, and there isn't
      a white man in the whole Roman-candle republic that a gentleman would
      associate with.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You forget Billy Geary,&rdquo; Webster reminded him gently.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He's a boy. What does his judgment amount to? Are you going
      to chase off to this God-forsaken fever-hole at the behest of a lad
      scarcely out of his swaddling clothes? Jack Webster, surely you aren't
      going to throw yourself away&mdash;give up the sure thing I offer you&mdash;to
      join Billy Geary in Sobrante and finance a wildcat prospect without a
      certificate of title attached. Why, Jack, my dear boy, don't you
      know that if you develop your mine to-morrow and get it paying well, the
      first 'liberator' may take it away from you or tax you for the
      entire output?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We'll have government protection, Neddy. This will be
      American capital, and if they get fresh, our Uncle Sam can send a warship,
      can't he?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He can&mdash;but he won't. Are you and Billy Geary of
      sufficient importance at home or abroad to warrant the vast consumption of
      coal necessary to send a battleship to protect your dubious prospect-hole?
      Be reasonable. What did you wire that confounded boy?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That I was coming.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Cable him you've changed, your mind. We'll send him
      some money to come home, and you can give him a good job under you. I'll
      O. K. the voucher and charge it to your personal expense account.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's nice of you, old sport, and I thank you kindly. I'll
      talk to Billy when I arrive in Buenaventura, and if the prospect doesn't
      look good to me, I'll argue him out of it and we'll come home.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I want you now. I don't want you to go away.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You promised me thirty days in which to have a good time&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So I did. But is this having a good time? How about that omelette
      soufflé all blazing with blue fire, and that shower-bath and the opera and
      mushing through the art centres, and Sousa's band&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They have a band down in Buenaventura. Billy says so.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It plays 'La Paloma' and 'Sobre las Olas'
      and 'La Golondrina' and all the rest of them. Jack, you'll
      go crazy listening to it.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I don't want any omelette soufflé, and I had a bath
      before I left the hotel. I was just hearing myself talk, Neddy,&rdquo; the
      culprit protested weakly. &ldquo;Let me go. I might come back. But I must
      go. I want to see Billy.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You just said a minute ago you'd turned the forty-year post,&rdquo;
      Jerome warned him. &ldquo;And you're now going to lose a year or two
      more in which you might better be engaged laying up a foundation of
      independence for your old age. You will get out of Sobrante with the price
      of a second-class ticket on a vile fruit boat, and you'll be back
      here panhandling around for a job at a quarter of what I am offering you.
      For Heaven's sake, man, don't be a fool.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, but I will be a fool,&rdquo; John Stuart Webster answered; and
      possibly, by this time, the reader has begun to understand the potency of
      his middle name&mdash;the Scotch are notoriously pig-headed, and Mr.
      Webster had just enough oatmeal in his blood to have come by that
      centre-fire name honestly. &ldquo;And you, you poor old horse, you could
      not possibly understand why, if you lived to be a million years old.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He got up from his chair to the full height of his six-feet-one, and
      stretched one hundred and ninety pounds of bone and muscle.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And so I shall go to Sobrante and lose all of this all-important
      money, shall I?&rdquo; he jeered. &ldquo;Then, by all the gods of the Open
      Country, I hope I may! Old man, you have browsed through a heap of
      literature in your day, but I doubt if it has done you any good. Permit me
      to map out a course of reading for you. Get a copy of 'Paradise Lost'
      and another of 'Cyrano de Bergerac.' In the former you will
      find a line running somewhat thusly: 'What tho' the cause be
      lost, all is not lost!' And in the immortal work of Monsieur
      Rostand, let me recommend one little page&mdash;about fifteen lines. Read
      them, old money-grubber, and learn! On second thought, do not read them.
      Those lines would only be wasted on you, for you have become afflicted
      with hypertrophy of the acquisitive sense, which thins the blood, dwarfs
      the understanding, stunts the perception of relative values, and chills
      the feet. .
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let me foretell your future for the next twenty years, Neddy. You
      will spend about forty per cent, of your time in this lounging-room,
      thirty per cent, of it in piling up a bank-roll, out of which you will
      glean no particular enjoyment, and the remaining thirty per cent, you will
      spend in bed. And then some bright morning your heart-beat will slow down
      almost imperceptibly, and the House Committee will order a wreath of
      autumn leaves hung just above Number Four domino table, and it will remain
      there until the next annual house-cleaning, when some swamper 'will
      say, 'What the devil is this stuff here for?' and forthwith he
      will tear it down and consign it to the fireplace.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ba-a-li,&rdquo; growled Jerome.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The truth hurts, I know,&rdquo; Webster pursued relentlessly,
      &ldquo;but hear me to the bitter end. And then presently shall enter the
      club no less a personage than young John Stuart Webster, even as he
      entered it to-day. He will be smelling of country with the hair on, and he
      will glance toward Table Number Four and murmur sympathetically: 'Poor
      old Jerome! I knowed him good!' Did I hear you say 'Huh!'
      just then? I thank thee for teaching me that word. Take careful note and
      see I use it correctly&mdash;'<i>Huh!</i>' Dad burn you,
      Neddy, I'm not a Methuselah. I want some fun in life. I want to
      fight and be broke and go hungry and then make money for the love of
      making it and spending it, and I want to live a long time yet. I have a
      constitutional weakness for foregathering with real he-men, doing real
      he-things, and if I'm to be happy, I'll just naturally have to
      be the he-est of the whole confounded pack! I want to see the mirage
      across the sagebrush and hear it whisper: 'Hither, John Stuart
      Webster! Hither, you fool, and I'll hornswaggle you again, as in an
      elder day I horn,swaggled you before.'&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Jerome shook his white thatch hopelessly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I thought you were a great mining engineer, John,&rdquo; he said
      sadly, &ldquo;but you're not. You're a poet. You do not seem
      to care for money.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; Webster retorted humorously, &ldquo;it isn't
      exactly what you might term a ruling passion. I like to make it, but there's
      more fun spending it. I've made a hundred thousand dollars, and now
      I want to go blow it&mdash;and I'm going to. Do not try to argue
      with me. I'm a lunatic and I will have my way. If I didn't go
      tearing off to Sobrante and join forces with Billy Geary, there to play
      the game, red or black, I'd feel as if I had done something low and
      mean and small. The boy's appealed to me, and I have made my answer.
      If I come back alive but broke, you know in your heart you'll give
      me the best job you have.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You win,&rdquo; poor Jerome admitted.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hold the job open thirty days. At the end of that period I'll
      give you a definite answer, Neddy.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There is no Balm in Gilead,&rdquo; Jerome replied sadly. &ldquo;Blessed
      are they that expect nothing, for they shall not be disappointed.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's six-thirty,&rdquo; Webster suggested. &ldquo;Let's
      eat. Last call for that omelette soufflé, and we'll go to a show
      afterward. By the way, Neddy, how do you like this suit? Fellow in Salt
      Lake built it for me&mdash;ninety bucks!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      But Jerome was not interested in clothing and similar foolishness. He only
      knew that he had lost the services of a mining engineer for whom he had
      searched the country for a month. He rose, dusting the cigar ashes from
      his vest, and followed sulkily.
    </p>
    <p>
      Despite the evidences of &ldquo;grouch&rdquo; which Jerome brought to the
      dinner table with John Stuart Webster, he was not proof against the latter's
      amazing vitality and boundless good spirits. The sheer weight of the
      Websterian optimism and power of enjoying simple things swept all of
      Jerome's annoyance from him as a brisk breeze dissipates the
      low-lying fog that hides a pleasant valley, and ere the second cocktail
      had made its appearance, the president of the Colorado Consolidated Mines
      Company, Limited, was doing his best to help Webster enjoy this one
      perfect night snatched from the grim processional of sunrise and sunset
      that had passed since last he had dallied with the fleshpots&mdash;that
      were to pass ere he should dally with them again according to his peculiar
      nature and inclination.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lovingly, lingeringly, Mr. Webster picked his way through the <i>hors d'ouvres</i>,
      declared against the soup as too filling, mixed the salad after a recipe
      of his own, served it and consumed it prior to the advent of the entrée,
      which if not the fashion in the West, at present, has not as yet gone
      entirely out of fashion. He revelled in breast of pheasant, with asparagus
      tips, and special baked potato; he thrilled with champagne at twelve
      dollars the quart, and a tender light came into his quizzical glance at
      sight of a brick of ice cream in four colours; he cheered for the omelette
      soufflé. In the end he demanded a tiny cheese fit for active service,
      cracked himself a peck of assorted nuts, and with a pot of black coffee
      and the best cigars possible of purchase in Denver, he leaned back at his
      ease and forgot the theatre in the long-denied delight of yarning with his
      old friend.
    </p>
    <p>
      At one o'clock next morning they were still seated in the cosy
      grill, smoking and talking. Jerome looked at his watch.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Great grief, Johnny!&rdquo; he declared. &ldquo;I must be trotting
      along. Haven't been out this late in years.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's the shank of the evening, Neddy,&rdquo; Webster pleaded,
      &ldquo;and I'm hungry again. We'll have a nice broiled
      lobster, with drawn butter&mdash;eh, Ned? And another quart of that
      '98?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My liver would never stand it. I'd be in bed for a week,&rdquo;
      Jerome protested. &ldquo;See you at the club to-morrow afternoon before
      you leave, I presume.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If I get through with my shopping in time,&rdquo; Webster answered,
      and reluctantly abandoning the lobster and accessories, he accompanied
      Jerome to the door and saw him safely into a taxicab.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sure you won't think it over, Jack, and give up this crazy
      proposition?&rdquo; he pleaded at parting.
    </p>
    <p>
      Webster shook his head. &ldquo;I sniff excitement and adventure and profit
      in Sobrante, Neddy, and I've just got to go look-see. I'm like
      an old burro staked out knee-deep in alfalfa just now. I won't take
      kindly to the pack&mdash;-&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And like an old burro, you won't be happy until you've
      sneaked through a hole in the fence to get out into a stubble-field and
      starve.&rdquo; Jerome swore halfheartedly and promulgated the trite
      proverb that life is just one blank thing after the other&mdash;an
      inchoate mass of liver and disappointment!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you find it so?&rdquo; Webster queried sympathetically.
    </p>
    <p>
      Suspecting that he was being twitted, Jerome looked up sharply, prepared
      to wither Webster with that glance. But no, the man was absolutely
      serious; whereupon Jerome realized the futility of further argument and
      gave John Stuart Webster up for a total loss. Still, he could not help
      smiling as he reflected how Webster had planned a year of quiet enjoyment
      and Fate had granted him one brief evening. He marvelled that Webster
      could be so light-hearted and contented under the circumstances.
    </p>
    <p>
      Webster read his thoughts. &ldquo;Good-bye, old man,&rdquo; he said, and
      extended his hand. &ldquo;Don't worry about me. Allah is always kind
      to fools, my friend; sorrow is never their portion. I've led rather
      a humdrum life. I've worked hard and never had any fun or excitement
      to speak of, and in answering Billy's call I have a feeling that I
      am answering the call of a great adventure.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He did not know how truly he spoke, of course, but if he had, that
      knowledge would not have changed his answer.

      CHAPTER V
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">T</span>HE morning
      following his decision to play the rôle of angel to Billy Geary's
      mining concession in Sobrante, John Stuart Webster, like Mr. Pepys, was up
      betimes.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nine o'clock found him in the office of his friend Joe Daingerfield,
      of the Bingham Engineering Works, where, within the hour, he had in his
      characteristically decisive fashion purchased the machinery for a
      ten-stamp mill and an electric light plant capability of generating two
      hundred and fifty horsepower two electric hoists with cable, half a dozen
      steel ore buckets, as many more ore-cars with five hundred feet of rail, a
      blacksmithing outfit, a pump, motors, sheet steel to line the
      crushing-bins and form shovelling platforms for the ore in the workings,
      picks, shovels drills, and so forth. It was a nice order and Dangerfield
      fwas delighted.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This is going to cost you about half your fortune, Jack,&rdquo; he
      informed Webster when the order was finally made up.
    </p>
    <p>
      Webster grinned. &ldquo;You don't suppose I'm chump enough to
      pay for it now, do you, Joe?&rdquo; he queried.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You'll pay at least half, my son. We love you, Jack; we
      honour and respect you; but this stuff is going to Central America, and in
      the event of your premature demise, we might not get it back. They have
      wars down there, you know, and when those people are war-mad, they destroy
      things.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know. But I'm going first to scout the country, Joe, and in
      the meantime keep all this stuff in your warehouse until I authorize you
      by cable to ship, when you can draw on me at sight for the entire invoice
      with bill of lading attached. If, upon investigation, I find that this
      mine isn't all my partner thinks it is, I'll cable a
      cancellation, and you can tear that nice fat order up and forget it. I don't
      intend to have you and that gang of penny-pinching card-room engineers up
      at the Engineers' Club remind me of the old adage that a fool and
      his money are soon parted.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      From Daingerfield's office Webster went forth to purchase a
      steamer-trunk, his railway ticket and sleeping-car reservation&mdash;after
      which he returned to his hotel and set about packing for the journey.
    </p>
    <p>
      He sighed regretfully as he folded his brand-new raiment, packed it in
      moth balls in his wardrobe-trunk, and ordered the trunk sent to a storage
      warehouse.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I was a giddy old bird of paradise for one night, at least,&rdquo;
      he comforted himself, as he dressed instead in a suit of light-weight
      olive drab goods in which he hoped to enjoy some measure of cool comfort
      until he should reach Buenaventura and thus become acquainted with the
      foibles of fashion in that tropical centre.
    </p>
    <p>
      The remainder of the afternoon he spent among his old friends of the
      Engineers' Club, who graciously tendered him a dollar table d'hote
      dinner that evening and saw him off for his train at ten o'clock,
      with many a gloomy prophecy as to his ultimate destiny&mdash;the
      prevailing impression appearing to be that he would return to them in a
      neat long box labelled: <i>This Side Up&mdash;With Care&mdash;Use No Hooks</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Old Neddy Jerome, as sour and cross as a setting hen,' accompanied
      him in the taxicab to the station, loth to let him escape and pleading to
      the last, in a forlorn hope that Jack Webster's better nature would
      triumph over his friendship and boyish yearning for adventure. He clung to
      Webster's arm as they walked slowly down the track and paused at the
      steps of the car containing the wanderer's reservation, just as a
      porter, carrying some hand-baggage, passed them by, followed by a girl in
      a green tailor-made suit. As she passed, John Stuart Webster looked fairly
      into her face, started as if bee-stung, and hastily lifted his hat. The
      girl briefly returned his scrutiny with sudden interest, decided she did
      not know him, and reproved him with a glance that even passé old Neddy
      Jerome did not fail to assimilate.
    </p>

      <a href="images/0075.jpg"><img src="images/enlarge.jpg" alt="" /> </a>
    </h5>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wow, wow!&rdquo; he murmured. &ldquo;The next time you try that,
      Johnny Webster, be sure you're right&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good land o' Goshen, Neddy,&rdquo; Webster replied. &ldquo;Fry
      me in bread-crumbs, if that isn't the same girl! Come to think of
      it, the conductor who gave me her name told me her ticket called for a
      stop-over in Denver! Let me go, Neddy. Quick! Good-bye, old chap. I'm
      on my way.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nonsense! The train doesn't pull out for seven minutes yet.
      Who is she, John, and why does she excite you so?&rdquo; Jerome recognized
      in his whimsical friend the symptoms of a most unusual malady&mdash;with
      Webster&mdash;and so he held the patient fast by the arm.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who is she, you ancient horse-thief? Why, if I have my way&mdash;and
      I'm certainly going to try to have it&mdash;she's the future
      Mrs. W.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Alas! Poor Yorick, I knowed him well,&rdquo; Jerome answered.
      &ldquo;Take a tip from the old man, John. I've been through the mill
      and I know. Never marry a girl that can freeze you with a glance. It isn't
      safe, and remember, you're not as young as you used to be. By the
      way, what's the fair charmer's name?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I've got it down in my memorandum book, but I can't
      recall it this minute&mdash;Spanish name.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;John, my dear boy, be careful,&rdquo; Neddy Jerome counseled.
      &ldquo;Stick to your own kind of people&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'll not. That girl is as trim and neat and beautiful as a
      newly minted guinea. What do I want with a Scotch lassie six feet tall and
      a believer in hell-fire and infant damnation?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is this&mdash;a&mdash;er&mdash;a nice girl, John?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How do I know&mdash;I mean, how dare you ask? Of course she's
      nice. Can't you see she is? And besides, why should you be so
      fearful&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'll have you understand, young man, that I have considerable
      interest in the girl you're going to marry. Drat it, boy, if you
      marry the wrong girl she may interfere with my plans. She may be a
      spoil-sport and not want to live up at the mine&mdash;after you return
      from this wild-goose chase, dragging your fool tail behind you. By the
      way, where did you first meet this girl? Who introduced you?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I haven't met her, and I've never been introduced,&rdquo;
      Webster complained, and poured forth the tale of his adventure on the
      train from Death Valley. Neddy was very sympathetic.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, no wonder she didn't recognize you when you saluted her
      to-night,&rdquo; he agreed. &ldquo;Thought you were another brute of a man
      trying to make a mash. By thunder, Jack, I'm afraid you made a
      mistake when you shed your whiskers and buried your old clothes. You don't
      look nearly so picturesque and romantic now, and maybe she'll refuse
      to believe you're the same man!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't care what she thinks. I found her, I lost her, and I've
      found her again; and I'm not going to take any further chances. I
      wired a detective agency to pick her up in Salt Lake and trail her to New
      Orleans and get me all the dope on her, while I was in temporary
      retirement with my black eye. Brainless fellows, these amateur detectives.
      I'll never employ one again. I described her accurately&mdash;told
      them she was beautiful and that she was wearing a green tailor-made suit;
      and will you believe me, Neddy, they reported to me next day that their
      operative failed to pick her up at the station? He said three beautiful
      women got off the train there, and that none of them wore a green dress.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, it's just barely possible she may have another dress,&rdquo;
      Jerome retorted slyly. &ldquo;Women are funny that way. They change their
      dresses about as often as they change their minds.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, that's so,&rdquo; Webster answered innocently. &ldquo;I
      never thought of that.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The porter, having delivered his charge's baggage in her section,
      was returning for another tip. Webster reached out and accosted him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Henry,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;do you want to earn a dollar?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, sah. Yes indeed, sah.'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where did you stow that young lady's hand-baggage?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Lower Six, Car Nine, sah.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have a weakness for coloured boys who are quick at figures,&rdquo;
      Webster declared, and dismissed the porter with the gratuity. He turned to
      Jerome. &ldquo;Neddy, I feel that I am answering the call to a great
      adventure,&rdquo; he declared solemnly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know it, Jack. Good-bye, son, and God bless you. If your fit of
      insanity passes within ninety days, cable me; and if you're broke,
      stick the Colorado Con' for the cable tolls.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good old wagon!&rdquo; Webster replied affectionately. Then he
      shook hands and climbed aboard the train. The instant he disappeared in
      the vestibule, however, Neddy Jerome waddled rapidly down the track to Car
      Nine, climbed aboard, and made his way to Lower Six. The young lady in the
      green tailor-made suit was there, looking idly out the window.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Young lady,&rdquo; Jerome began, &ldquo;may I presume to address
      you for a moment on a matter of very great importance to you? Don't
      be afraid of me, my dear. I'm old enough to be your father, and
      besides, I'm one of the nicest old men you ever met.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      She could not forbear a smile. &ldquo;Very well, sir,&rdquo; she replied.
    </p>
    <p>
      Neddy Jerome produced a pencil and card. &ldquo;Please write your name on
      this card,&rdquo; he pleaded, &ldquo;and I'll telegraph what I want
      to say to you. There'll be a man coming through this car in a
      minute, and I don't want him to see me here&mdash;besides which, the
      train leaves in half a minute, and I live in Denver and make it a point to
      be home and in bed not later than ten each night. Please trust me, young
      lady.&rdquo; ^
    </p>
    <p>
      The young lady did not trust him, however, although she wrote on the card.
      Jerome thanked her and fled as fast as his fat old legs could carry him.
      Under the station arc he read the card.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Henrietta Wilkins,'&rdquo; he murmured. &ldquo;By the
      gods, one would never suspect a name like that belonged to a face like
      that. I know that name is going to jar Jack and cause him to seethe with
      ambition to change it. He'll trim the <i>Henrietta</i> down to plain
      <i>Retta</i>, and change <i>Wilkins to Webster!</i> By jingo, it <i>would</i>
      be strange if that madman persuaded her to marry him. I hope he does. If I'm
      any judge of character, Jack Webster won't be cruel enough to chain
      that vision to Sobrante; and besides, she's liable to make him
      decide who's most popular with him&mdash;Henrietta or Billy Geary.
      If she does, I'll play Geary to lose. However, if that confirmed old
      bachelor wants to chase rainbows, I might as well help him out, since
      whichever way the cat jumps I can't lose. It's to my interest
      to have him marry that girl, or any girl, for that matter, because she'll
      have something to say about the advisability of kicking aside what
      amounts, approximately, to thirty thousand a year, in order to sink the
      family bankroll in a wildcat mine in the suburbs of hell. Well! Needs must
      when the devil drives.&rdquo; And he entered the station telegraph office
      and commenced to write.
    </p>
    <p>
      An hour later Miss Dolores Ruey, alias Henrietta Wilkins, was handed this
      remarkably verbose and truly candid telegram:
    </p>
    <p>
      Denver, Colo., Aug. 7, 1913. Miss Henrietta Wilkins,
    </p>
    <p>
      Lower 6, Car 9,
    </p>
    <p>
      On board train 24.
    </p>
    <p>
      Do you recall the bewhiskered, ragged individual you met on the S.P., L.A.
      &amp; S.L. train in Death Valley ten days ago? He thrashed a man who
      annoyed you, but owing to a black eye and his generally unpresentable
      appearance, he remained in his stateroom the remainder of the trip and you
      did not see him again until to-night. He lifted his hat to you to-night,
      and you almost killed him with a look. It did not occur to him that you
      would not recognize him disguised as a gentleman, and he lifted his hat on
      impulse. Do not hold it against him. The sight of you again set his reason
      tottering on its throne, and he told me his sad story.
    </p>
    <p>
      This man, John Stuart Webster, is wealthy, single, forty, fine, and crazy
      as a March hare. He is in love with you.
    </p>
    <p>
      You might do worse than fall in love with him. He is the best mining
      engineer in the world, and he is now aboard the same train with you, en
      route to New Orleans, thence to take the steamer to Buenaventura,
      Sobrante, C. A., where he is to meet another lunatic and finance a hole in
      the ground. He has just refused a thirty-thousand-dollar-a-year job from
      me to answer the call of a mistaken friendship. I do not want him to go to
      Sobrante. If you marry him, he will not. If you do not marry him, you
      still might arrange to make him listen to reason. If you can induce him to
      come to work for me within the next ninety days, whether you marry him or
      not, I will give you five thousand dollars the day he reports on the job.
      Please bear in mind that he does not know I am doing this. If he did, he
      would kill me, but business is business, and this is a plain business
      proposition. I am putting you wise, so you will know your power and can
      exercise it if you care to earn the money. If not, please forget about it.
      At any rate, please do me the favour to communicate with me on the
      subject, if at all interested.

    <p>
      President Colorado Consolidated Mines, Limited.
    </p>
    <p>
      Care Engineers' Club.
    </p>
    <p>
      The girl read and reread this telegram several times, and presently a slow
      little smile commenced to creep around the corners of her adorable mouth,
      for out of the chaos of emotions induced by Ned Jerome's amazing
      proposition, the humour of the situation had detached itself to the
      elimination of everything else.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I believe that amazing old gentleman is absolutely dependable,&rdquo;
      was the decision at which she ultimately arrived, and calling for a
      telegraph blank, she wired the old schemer:
    </p>
    <p>
      Five thousand not enough money. Make it ten thousand and I will guarantee
      to deliver the man within ninety days. I stay on this train to New
      Orleans.
    </p>
    <p>
      Henrietta.
    </p>
    <p>
      That telegram arrived at the Engineers' Club about midnight, and
      pursuant to instructions, the night barkeeper read it and phoned the
      contents to Neddy Jerome, who promptly telephoned his reply to the
      telegraph office, and then sat on the edge of his bed, scratching his toes
      and meditating.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's a remarkable young woman,&rdquo; he decided, &ldquo;and
      business to her finger-tips. Like the majority of her sex, she's out
      for the dough. Well, I've done my part, and it's now up to
      Jack Webster to protect himself in the clinches and breakaways.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      About daylight a black hand passed Neddy Jerome's reply through the
      berth-curtains to Dolores Ruey. She read:
    </p>
    <p>
      Accept. When you deliver the goods, communicate with me and get your
      money.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jerome.
    </p>
    <p>
      She snuggled back among the pillows and considered the various aspects of
      this amazing contract which she had undertaken with a perfect stranger.
      Hour after hour she lay there, thinking over this.
    </p>
    <p>
      As she passed, John Stuart Webster looked fairly into her face, v started
      as if bee-stung, and hastily lifted his hat preposterous situation, and
      the more she weighed it, the more interesting and attractive the
      proposition appeared. But one consideration troubled her. How would the
      unknown knight manage an introduction? Or, if he failed to manage it, how
      was she to overcome that obstacle?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, dear,&rdquo; she murmured, &ldquo;I do hope he's brave.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      She need not have worried. Hours before, the object of her thought had
      settled all that to his own complete satisfaction, and as a consequence
      was sleeping peacefully and gaining strength for whatever of fortune, good
      or ill, the morrow might bring forth.

      CHAPTER VI
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">D</span>AY was dawning in
      Buenaventura, republic of Sobrante, as invariably it dawns in the tropics&mdash;without
      extended preliminary symptoms. The soft, silvery light of a full moon that
      had stayed out scandalously late had merged imperceptibly into gray; the
      gray was swiftly yielding place to a faint crimson that was spreading and
      deepening upward athwart the east.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the Calle Nueva a game cock, pride of an adoring family of Sobrante's
      lower class, crowed defiance to a neighbouring bird. A dog barked. From
      the patch of vivid green at the head of the Calle San Rosario a troupe of
      howling monkeys raised a sun-up cheer that marked the finish of a night of
      roystering; from wattled hut and adobe <i>casa</i> brunette women in red
      calico wrappers came forth, sleepy-eyed and dishevelled; and presently
      from a thousand little adobe fireplaces in a thousand backyards thin blue
      spirals of smoke mounted&mdash;incense to the household gods of Sobrante&mdash;Tortilla
      and Frijoles. Brown men, black men, lemon-tinted men, and white men whose
      fingernails showed blue instead of white at the base, came to the doors of
      their respective habitations, leaned against them, lighted post-breakfast
      cigarettes, and waited for somebody to start something.
    </p>
    <p>
      To these indolent watchers of the dawn was vouchsafed presently the sight
      of Senora Concepcion Josefina Morelos on her way to early mass at the
      Catedral de la Vera Cruz. Men called to each other, when she passed, that
      Senora Morelos shortly would seek, in a Carmelite convent, surcease from
      the grief caused by the premature demise of her husband, General Pablo
      Morelos, at the hands of a firing-squad in the <i>cuartel</i> yard, as a
      warning to others of similar kidney to forbear and cease to tamper with
      the machinery of politics. And when Senora Morelos had passed, came
      Alberto Guzman with two smart mules hitched to a dilapidated street-car;
      came Don Juan Cafetéro, <i>peseta</i>-less, still slightly befuddled from
      his potations of the night before, and raising the echoes in the <i>calle</i>
      with a song singularly alien to his surroundings:
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      Green were the fields where my forefathers dwelt&mdash;
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      O, Erin, mavourneen, slan laght go bragh!
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      At the theatre we sit patiently waiting for the stage electrician to
      switch on the footlights and warn us that the drama is about to begin. Let
      us, in a broader sense, appropriate that cue to mark the beginning of the
      drama with which this story deals; instead of a stage, however, we have
      the republic of Sobrante; in lieu of footlights we have the sun popping up
      out of the Caribbean Sea.
    </p>
    <p>
      Those actors whose acquaintance we have so briefly made thus far must be
      presumed to be supers crossing the stage and loitering thereon while the
      curtain is down. Now, therefore, let us drive them into the wings while
      the curtain rises on a tropical scene.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the <i>patio</i> of Mother Jenks's establishment in the Çalle de
      Concordia, No. 19, the first shafts of morning light were filtering
      obliquely through the orange trees and creeping in under the deep,
      Gothic-arched veranda flanking the western side of the <i>patio</i>, to
      reveal a dusky maiden of more or less polyglot antecedents, asleep upon a
      bright, parti-coloured blanket spread over a wicker couch.
    </p>
    <p>
      Presently, through the silent reaches of the Calle de Concordia, the sound
      of a prodigious knocking and thumping echoed, as of some fretful
      individual seeking admission at the street door of El Buen Amigo, by which
      euphonious designation Mother Jenks's caravansary was known to the
      public of Buenaventura. In the second story, front, a window slid back and
      a woman's voice, husky with that huskiness that speaks so accusingly
      of cigarettes and alcohol, demanded:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>Quien es?</i> Who is it? <i>Que quiere usted?</i> Wot do yer
      want?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ye might dispinse wit' that paraqueet conversation whin
      addhressin' the likes av me,&rdquo; a voice replied. &ldquo;'Tis
      me&mdash;Cafferty. I have a cablegram Leber give me to deliver&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Gawd's truth! Would yer wake the 'ole 'ouse with
      yer'ammering?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All right. I'll not say another worrd!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      A minute passed; then the same husky voice, the owner of which had
      evidently descended from her sleeping chamber above, spoke in a steadily
      rising crescendo from a room just off the veranda:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Car-may-lee-ta-a-a!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      We can serve no useful purpose by endeavouring to conceal from the reader,
      even temporarily, the information that Carmelita was the sleeping naiad on
      the couch; also that she continued to sleep, for hers was that quality of
      slumber which is the heritage of dark blood and defies any commotion short
      of that incident to a three-alarm fire. Three times the husky voice
      addressed Carmelita with cumulative vehemence; but Carmelita slept on, and
      presently the husky voice ceased to cry aloud for her. Followed the sound
      of bare feet thudding across the floor.
    </p>
    <p>
      Forth from the house came Mother Jenks, a redfaced, coarse-jowled,
      slightly bearded lady of undoubted years and indiscretion, in curl-papers
      and nightgown, barefoot and carrying a bucket. One scornful glance at the
      sleeping Carmelita, and mother Jenks crossed to the fountain plashing in
      the centre of the <i>patio</i>, filled her bucket, stepped to the veranda
      and dashed three gallons of tepid water into Carme-lita's face.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>That</i> awakened Carmelita&mdash;Mother Jenks's raucous &ldquo;Git
      up, yer bloody wench! Out, yer 'ussy, an' cook <i>almuerzo</i>.
      Gawd strike me pink, if I don't give yer the sack for this&mdash;an'
      sleepin' on my best new blenkit!&rdquo; being in the nature of a
      totally unnecessary exordium.
    </p>
    <p>
      Carmelita shrieked and fled, while Mother Jenks scuttled along in pursuit
      like a belligerent old duck, the while she heaped opprobrium upon
      Carmelita and all her tribe, the republic of Sobrante, its capital, its
      government officials, and the cable company: Finally she disappeared into
      El Buen Amigo with a hearty Cockney oath at her own lack of foresight in
      ever permitting her sainted 'Enery to set foot on a foreign shore.
    </p>
    <p>
      Once inside, Mother Jenks proceeded down a tiled hallway to the <i>cantina</i>
      of her hostelry and opened the street door a few inches. Without the
      portal stood Don Juan Cafetéro, of whom a word or two before proceeding.
    </p>
    <p>
      To begin, Don Juan Cafetéro was not his real name, but rather a free
      Spanish translation of the Gaelic, John Cafferty. As would be indicated by
      the song he was singing when first we made his acquaintance, coupled with
      the unstable condition of his legs, Mr. Cafferty was an exile of Erin with
      a horrible thirst. He had first arrived in Sobrante some five years
      before, as section-boss in the employ of the little foreign-owned
      narrow-gauge railway which ran from Buenaventura on the Caribbean coast to
      San Miguel de Padua, up-country where the nitrate beds were located. Prior
      to his advent the railroad people had tried many breeds of section-boss
      without visible results, until a Chicago man, who had come to Sobrante to
      install an intercommunicating telephone system in the Government
      buildings, suggested to the superintendent of the road, who was a German,
      that the men made for bosses come from Erin's isle; wherefore Mr.
      Cafferty had been imported at a price of five dollars a day gold. Result&mdash;a
      marked improvement in the road-bed and consequently the train-schedules,
      and the ultimate loss of the Cafferty soul.
    </p>
    <p>
      Don Juan, with the perversity of the Celt, and contrary to precept and
      example, forbore to curse Sobrante. On the contrary, he liked Sobrante
      immediately upon arrival and so stated in public&mdash;this unusual state
      of affairs doubtless being due to the fact that his job furnished much of
      excitement and interest, for his driving tactics were not calculated to
      imbue in his dusky section-hands a love for the new section-boss; and from
      the day he took charge until he lost the job, the life of Don Juan
      Cafetéro had been equivalent in intrinsic value to two squirts of swamp
      water&mdash;possibly one.
    </p>
    <p>
      Something in the climate of Sobrante must have appealed to a touch of <i>laissez
      faire</i> in Don Juan's amiable nature, for in the course of time he
      had taken unto himself, without bell or book, after the fashion of the
      proletariat of Sobrante, the daughter of one Estebân Manuel Enrique José
      Maria Pasqual y Miramontes, an estimable peon who was singularly glad to
      have his daughter off his hands and no questions asked. Following the
      fashion of the country, however, Esteban had forthwith moved the remainder
      of his numerous progeny under the mantle of Don Juan Cafetéro's
      philanthropy, and resigned a position which for many years he had not
      enjoyed&mdash;to wit: salting and packing green hides at a local <i>abattoir</i>.
      This foolhardy economic move had so incensed Don Juan that in a fit of
      pique he spurned his father-in-law (we must call Esteban something and so
      why split hairs?) under the tails of his <i>camisa</i>, with such vigour
      as to sever forever the friendly relations hitherto existing between the
      families. Mrs. Cafferty (again we transgress, but what of it?)
      subsequently passed away in childbirth, and no sooner had she been
      decently buried than Don Juan took a week off to drown his sorrows.
    </p>
    <p>
      In this condition he had encountered Esteban Manuel Enrique José Maria
      Pasqual y Miramontes and called him out of his name&mdash;for which there
      appears to be little excuse, in view of the many the latter possessed. In
      the altercation that ensued Esteban, fully convinced that he had received
      the nub end of the transaction from start to finish, cut Don Juan severely
      in the region of the umbilicus; Don Juan had thereupon slain Esteban with
      a .44-calibre revolver, and upon emerging from the railroad hospital a
      month later had been tried by a Sobrantean magistrate and fined the sum of
      twenty thousand dollars, legal tender of the Republic of Sobrante. Of
      course he had paid it off within six months from his wages as
      section-boss, but the memory of the injustice always rankled in him, and
      gradually he moved down the scale of society from section-boss to day
      labourer, day labourer to tropical tramp, and tropical tramp to
      beach-comber, in which latter state he had now existed for several months.
    </p>
    <p>
      While waiting to round out the brief period of existence which drink and
      the devil had left him, this poor human fragment had become a protégé of
      Ignatz Leber, an Alsatian, manager for a German importing and exporting
      house, and agent for the cable company. By the grace of the philanthropic
      Ignatz, Don Juan slept under Leber's warehouse and ate in his
      kitchen.

      CHAPTER VII
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">B</span>EFORE Don Juan
      could even utter a matutinal greeting, Mother Jenks laid finger to lip and
      silenced him. &ldquo;Go back to Leber's and return in an hour,&rdquo;
      she whispered. &ldquo;I 'ave my reasons for wantin' that
      bloomin' cablegram delivered later.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Don Juan hadn't the least idea what Mother Jenks's reasons
      might be, but he presumed she was up to some chicanery, and so he winked
      his bloodshot eye very knowingly and nodded his acquiescence in the
      program; whereupon Mother Jenks started to close the door. Instantly Don
      Juan's foot was in the jamb; in a hoarse whisper he said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Whilst ye're askin' favours, woman dear, ye might have
      the kindness to ask me if I have a mouth.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bloomin' well I knows yer 'ave a mouth, for bloomin'
      well I smell yer blawsted breath,&rdquo; Mother Jenks retorted. However,
      the present was no time to raise an issue with Don Juan, and so she
      slipped behind the bar of her <i>cantina</i>, poured five fingers of <i>aguardiente</i>,
      the local brand of disturbance, and handed it to Don Juan through the
      crack in the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here's all the hair off your head,&rdquo; Don Juan Cafetéro
      saluted her amiably. He tossed it off at a gulp, handed Mother Jenks the
      glass, and departed with a whispered promise to return in an hour.
    </p>
    <p>
      When he had gone, Mother Jenks went behind the bar and fortified herself
      with her morning's morning&mdash;which rite having been performed,
      her sleep-benumbed brain livened up immediately.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Gord's truth!&rdquo; the lady murmured. &ldquo;An' me
      about to turn him adrift for the lawst fortnight! Well for 'im
      'e allers hadmired the picture o' my sainted 'Enery, as
      was the spittin' image of his own fawther. 'Evings! 'Ell's
      bells! But that was a bit of a tight squeak! Just as I'm fully
      conwinced 'e's beat it an' I'm left 'oldin'
      the sack, all along o' my kindness of 'eart, 'e gets the

      'e allers claimed as 'ow any time'e got a cablegram it'd
      be an answer to 'is letter, with money to foller! My word, but that
      was touch an' go! An' yet Willie's got such a tykin'
      w'y about him, I might 'ave knowed 'e was a gentleman!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Still congratulating herself upon her good fortune in intercepting Don
      Juan Cafetéro, Mother Jenks proceeded upstairs to her chamber, clothed
      herself, and adjourned to the kitchen, where Carmelita was already engaged
      in the preparation of the morning meal. After giving orders for an extra
      special breakfast for two, Mother Jenks returned to her <i>cantina</i>,
      and formally opened the same for the business of that day and night; while
      a lank Jamaica negro swept out the room and cleaned the cuspidors, she
      washed and polished her glassware and set her back bar in order. To her
      here came presently, via the tiled hallway, the object of her solicitude,
      a young man on the sunny side of thirty. At the first glance one suspected
      this individual to be a member of the Caucasian race; at the second glance
      one verified this suspicion. He was thin for one of his height and breadth
      of chest; in colour his countenance resembled that of a sick Chinaman. His
      hair was thick and wavy but lustreless; his dark blue eyes carried a hint
      of jaundice; and a generous mouth, beneath an equally generous upper lip,
      gave ample ground for the suspicion that while Mr. William Geary's
      speech denoted him an American citizen, at least one of his maternal
      ancestors had been wooed and won by an Irishman. An old panama hat, sad
      relic of a prosperous past, a pair of soiled buckskin pumps, a suit of
      unbleached linen equally befouled, and last but not least, the remnants of
      a smile that much hard luck could never quite obliterate, completed his
      attire&mdash;and to one a stranger in the tropics would appear to
      constitute a complete inventory of Mr. Geary's possessions. An
      experienced person, however, would have observed immediately that Mother
      Jenks's seedy guest had been bitten deeply and often by mosquitoes
      and was, in consequence, the proprietor of a low malarial fever, with its
      concomitant chills.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>Dulce corazon mio</i>, I extend a greeting,&rdquo; he called at
      the entrance. &ldquo;I trust you rested well last night, Mother Jenks, and
      that no evil dreams were born of your midnight repast of <i>frijoles
      refritos</i>, marmalade, and arf-an'-arf!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Chop yer spoofin', Willie,&rdquo; Mother Jenks simpered.
      &ldquo;My heye! So I'm yer sweet'eart, eh? Yer wheedlin'
      blighter, makin' love to a girl as is old enough to be yer mother!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A woman,&rdquo; Mr. Geary retorted sagely and not a whit abashed,
      &ldquo;is at the apex of her feminine charms at thirty-seven.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He knew his landlady to be not a day under fifty, but such is the ease
      with which the Irish scatter their blarney, and such the vanity of the
      gentler sex (for despite Mother Jenks's assault upon Carmelita, we
      include the lady in that pleasing category), that neither Billy Geary nor
      Mother Jenks regarded this pretty speech in the light of an observation
      immaterial, inconsequential and not germane to the matter at issue. For
      Mother Jenks was the eternal feminine, and it warmed the cockles of her
      heart to be told she was only thirty-seven, even though reason warned her
      that the compliment was not garnished with the sauce of sincerity. As for
      Billy, the sight of Mother Jenks swallowing this specious bait, together
      with hook, line, and sinker, always amused him and for the nonce took his
      mind off his own troubles. Nevertheless, there was a deeper reason for his
      blarney. This morning, watching the tell tale tinge of pleasure underlying
      the alcohol-begotten hue of the good creature's face, he felt almost
      ashamed of his own heartlessness&mdash;almost, but not quite.
    </p>
    <p>
      Let us take Billy's view of his own case and view his mendacity with
      a kindly and tolerant eye. For two months he had existed entirely because
      of the leniency of Mother Jenks in the matter of credit.
    </p>
    <p>
      He could not pay her cash, devoutly as he hoped to do some day, and he
      considered it of the most vital importance that in the interim he should
      somehow survive. Therefore, in lieu of cash he paid her compliments, which
      she snapped up greedily.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the cold gray dawn of the morning after Mother Jenks always detected
      the bug in Billy's amber and vowed to rout him bag and baggage that
      very day; but when one is fond of blarney, it is hard indeed to destroy
      the source of it; and while Mother Jenks's courage had mounted to
      the point of action many a time, in the language of the sporting extra,
      Billy had always &ldquo;beaten her to the punch&rdquo;; for when instinct
      warned him that Mother Jenks was about to talk business, he could always
      rout her by declaring she was pencilling her eyebrows or rouging her
      cheeks.
    </p>
    <p>
      An inventive genius was Billy. He never employed the same defensive
      tactics two days in succession, and when personal flattery threatened to
      fail him, a large crayon reproduction of the late Henry Jenks, which hung
      over the back bar, was a never-failing source of inspiration.
    </p>
    <p>
      This was the &ldquo;sainted'Enery&rdquo; previously referred to by
      Mother Jenks. He had been a sergeant in Her Brittanic Majesty's
      Royal Horse Artillery, and upon retiring to the Reserve had harkened to a
      proposition to emigrate to Sobrante and accept a commission as colonel of
      artillery with the Government forces then in the throes of a revolutionary
      attack. The rebels had triumphed, and as a result 'Enery had been
      sainted via the customary expeditious route; whereupon his wife had had
      recourse to her early profession of barmaid, and El Buen Amigo had
      resulted.
    </p>
    <p>
      However, let us return to our sheeps, as Mr. Geary would have expressed
      it. Seemingly the effect of Billy's compliment was instantly
      evident, for Mother Jenks set out two glasses and a bottle.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know yer a trifler, Willy Geary,&rdquo; she simpered, &ldquo;but
      if I do s'y it as shouldn't, I was accounted as 'andsome
      a barmaid as you'd find in Bristol town. I've lost my good
      looks, what with grief an' worritin' since losin' my
      sainted 'Enery, but I was 'andsome oncet.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can well believe it, Mother&mdash;since you are handsome still!
      For my part,&rdquo; he continued confidentially, as with shaking hand he
      filled his brandy-glass, &ldquo;you'll excuse this drunkard's
      drink, Mother, but I need it; I had the shakes again last night&mdash;for
      my part, I prefer the full-blown rose to the bud.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Mother Jenks fluttered like a <i>debutante</i> as she poured her drink.
      They touched glasses, calloused worldlings that they were.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Ow,&rdquo; said Mother Jenks, toasting the philandering
      wretch.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How!&rdquo; He tossed off his drink. It warmed and strengthened
      him, after his night of chills and fever, and brazenly he returned to the
      attack.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Changing the subject from feminine grace and charm to manly
      strength and virtue, I've been marking lately the resolute poise of
      your martyred husband's head on his fine military shoulders. There
      was a man, if I may judge from his photograph, that would fight a wildcat.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, m'ybe 'e wouldn't!&rdquo; Mother Jenks
      hastened to declare. &ldquo;You know, Willie, I was present w'en
      they shot 'im, a-waitin' to claim 'is body. 'E
      kisses me good-bye, an' says 'e: 'Brace up, ol'
      girl. Remember your 'usband's been a sergeant in 'Er
      Majesty's Royal 'Orse Artillery, an' don't let the
      bloody blighters see yer cry.' Then 'e walks out front, with
      'is fine straight back to the wall, draws a circle on 'is blue
      tunic with white chalk an' says: 'Shoot at that, yer
      yeller-bellied bounders, an' be damned to yer!'&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To be the widow of such a gallant son of Mars,&rdquo; Billy
      declared, &ldquo;is a greater honour than being the wife of a duke.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      For the sake of 'Enery's memory Mother Jenks squeezed out a
      tear. Billy would have egged her on to a lachrymal flood, for he knew she
      would enjoy it, but at that moment entered Carmelita, to announce
      breakfast.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mother Jenks, recalling her husband's last advice, declined to let
      even a Sobrantean girl see her weep. She composed herself instantly,
      filled her glass again, and pushed the bottle to Billy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Ave another peg with Mother, Willie.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'll go you, Mother, although it's really my turn to
      set 'em up. I would if I had the price. However, I'm expecting
      action on that concession of mine pretty soon, Mother, and when I get
      straightened out, they'll date time in the Calle de Concordia from
      the spending toot I'll inaugurate. Ah, Mother,&rdquo; he added with
      a note of genuine gratitude and sincerity, &ldquo;you've been
      awfully good to me. I don't know what I'd have done without
      you.&rdquo; He laid his hand on her fat arm. &ldquo;Mother, one of these
      days I'll get mine, and when I do I'm going to stake you to a
      nice little pub back in Bristol.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      She smiled at him with motherly tenderness and shook her head. In a
      concrete niche in the mortuary of the Catedrâl de la Vera Cruz the bones
      of her sainted 'Enery reposed, and when her hour came she would lie
      beside him. Moreover, she was a tropical tramp. She had grown to like
      Sobrante, for all her railing against it, and she knew she would never see
      the chalk cliffs of Albion again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yer a sweet boy, Willie,&rdquo; she told him, &ldquo;an' I'd
      trust yer for double the score, s'help me. 'Eving knows I
      'aven't much, but wot I 'ave I shares freely with them I
      likes. I 'ave a brace o' duck heggs, 'am an'
      'ot cakes, Willie, an' yer 'll breakfuss with Mother.
      Duck heggs, 'am an' 'ot cakes, Willie. 'Ow's
      that? Eh, yer precious byby.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Billy's glistening eyes testified to the profundity of his feelings
      at the prospect of this Lucullan feast. It had been long since Mother
      Jenks's larder had yielded him anything more stable than brown
      beans, tortillas, fried onions, and an occasional dab of marmalade, and
      the task of filling in the corners of his appetite with free tropical
      fruit had long since grown irksome.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mother Jenks preceded him into the shady side of the veranda, where
      ordinarily she was wont to breakfast in solitary state. Her table was set
      for two this morning, however, but this extraordinary circumstance was
      lost sight of by the shameless Billy in the prospect of one more real meal
      before the chills and fever claimed their own. He flipped an adventurous
      cockroach off the table and fell to with fine appetite.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was dallying with a special brew of coffee, with condensed milk in it,
      when the Jamaica negro entered from the <i>cantina</i> to announce Don
      Juan Cafe-téro with a cablegram.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A cablegram!&rdquo; Mother Jenks cried. &ldquo;Gord's truth!
      I'll wager the pub it's for you, Willie.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wonder! Can it be possible it's come at last?&rdquo; Billy
      cried incredulously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'd not be surprised,&rdquo; Mother Jenks replied. &ldquo;Bob&rdquo;&mdash;turning
      to the negro, and addressing him in her own private brand of Spanish&mdash;&ldquo;give
      Don Juan a drink, if 'e 'asn't helped 'imself
      while yer back is turned, an' bring the cablegram 'ere.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Within the minute Bob returned with a long yellow envelope, which he
      handed Mother Jenks. Without so much as a glance at the superscription,
      she handed it to Billy Geary, who tore it open and read:
    </p>
    <p>
      Los Angeles, Calif., U. S. A., August 16, 1913.
    </p>
    <p>
      Henrietta Wilkins,
    </p>
    <p>
      Calle de Concordia, No. 19,
    </p>
    <p>
      Buenaventura,
    </p>
    <p>
      Sobrante, C. A.
    </p>
    <p>
      Leaving to-day to visit you. Will cable from New Orleans exact date
      arrival.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dolores.
    </p>
    <p>
      The shadow of deep disappointment settled over Billy's face as he
      read. Mother Jenks noted it instantly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wot's 'e got to s'y, Willie?&rdquo; she demanded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It isn't a he. It's a she,&rdquo; Billy replied.
      &ldquo;Besides, the cablegram isn't for me at all. It's for
      one Henrietta Wilkins, Calle de Concordia, Number Nineteen, and who the
      devil Henrietta Wilkins may be is a mystery to me. Ever have any boarder
      by that name, Mother?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Mother Jenks's red face had gone white. &ldquo;'Enrietta
      Wilkins was my maiden nyme, Willie,&rdquo; she confessed soberly, &ldquo;an'
      there's only one human as 'ud cable me or write me by that
      nyme. Gord, Willie, wot's 'appened?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'll read it to you, Mother.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Billy read the message aloud; and when he had finished, to his amazement,
      Mother Jenks laid her head on the table and began to weep.

      CHAPTER VIII
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">W</span>HEN Billy Geary
      could reorganize himself, as it were, after the shock incident to his
      discovery that the cablegram was not for him after all, he turned his
      attention to Mother Jenks. Without quite realizing why he did so, Billy
      decided that fear and not grief was at the bottom of the good creature's
      distress, and in his awkward, masculine way he placed his arm around
      Mother Jenks's shoulders, shook her gently, and bade her remember
      that chaos might come and go again, but he, the said William Geary, would
      remain her true and steadfast friend in any and all emergencies that might
      occur.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Gor' bless yer heart, Willie,&rdquo; Mother Jenks sniffled.
      &ldquo;If this was only somethink I could hentrust to a man! But it ain't.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, suppose you tell me what it is and let me be the judge,&rdquo;
      Billy suggested. &ldquo;I haven't got one <i>centavo</i> to rub
      against the other, and on present form and past performances I'm the
      last man in the world to handle an affair between two women, but&mdash;I
      have a head on my shoulders, and nobody ever had reason to suspect that
      head of being empty. Perhaps, if you care to give me your confidence, I
      may be of service to you, Mother.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Willie,&rdquo; his landlady wailed, &ldquo;I dunno wot in 'ell
      yer ever goin' to think o' me w'en I tell ye wot I've
      been up to this past fifteen year.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Whatever you've been up to, Mother, it was a kind and
      charitable deed&mdash;of that much I am certain,&rdquo; Billy replied
      loftily and&mdash;to his own surprise&mdash;sincerely.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As Gord is my judge, Willie, it started out that w'y,&rdquo;
      moaned Mother Jenks, and she squeezed Billy's hand as if from that
      yellow, shaking member she would draw aid and comfort. &ldquo;'Er
      nyme is Dolores Ruey.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Any relation to the Ruey family of Buenaventura?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A first cousin, Willie. 'Er father was Don Ricardo Ruey, <i>présidente</i>
      av this blasted 'ell on earth w'en me an' my sainted
      'Enery first come to Buenaventura. 'E was too good for the
      yeller-bellied beggars; 'e tried to do somethink for them an'
      run the government on the square, an' they couldn't
      hunderstand, all along o' 'avin' been kicked an'
      cuffed by a long line of bloody rotters. It was Don Ricardo as gives my
      sainted 'Enery 'is commission as colonel in the hartillery.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That was all very well, you know, Willie, only Don Ricardo didn't
      go far enough. If 'e'd only 'arkened to 'Enery's
      advice an' imported a lot o' bloomin' Tommies to serve
      'Enery's guns, 'im an' 'Enery never would
      'ave faced that firin'-squad. Many's the time 'Enery's
      said to me: ''Enrietta, me 'art's broke tryin'
      to myke gunners out o' them blackamoors Don Ricardo gives me to
      serve the screwguns. They've been born without a sense o'
      distance!' Gor' bless you, Willie, my sainted 'Enery
      'ad no bloomin' use for a range-finder. 'E'd cast
      'is eye over the ground an' then try a shot for distance. M'ybe'e'd
      be a bit short. 'A bit more elevation, <i>amigos</i>,' says
      'Enery, an' tries again. This time 'e's a bit over
      it, m'ybe, but the third or fourth shot 'e 'as the range
      an' stays right on the target. But then, Willie, as 'Enery
      used to s'y to me: ''Enrietta, how in blazes can I serve
      six guns? How can a colonel of hartillery come down off 'is 'orse
      an do a gunner's work? It ain't dignified.'&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Billy nodded. He had heard that story so often in the past that he knew it
      by heart; from all he could learn the sainted 'Enery quite resembled
      a horse, in that he had room in his head for but one thought at a time. As
      a gunner-sergeant he was doubtless a loss to the British service, but as a
      colonel of So-brantean artillery he had tried to forget that once he had
      been a gunner-sergeant!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You've 'eard me tell,&rdquo; Mother Jenks continued,
      &ldquo;'ow the rebels got 'arf a dozen Hamerican gunners&mdash;deserters
      from the navy&mdash;an' blew 'Enery's battery to bits,
      'ow the Government forces fell back upon Buenaventura, an' as
      'ow w'en the dorgs begun to wonder if they mightn't
      lose, they quit by the 'undreds an' went over to the rebel
      side, leavin' Don Ricardo an' 'Enery an' m'ybe
      fifty o' the gentry in the palace. In course they fought to a
      finish; 'ristocrats, all of them, they 'ad to die fightin'
      or facin' a firin'-squad.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Again Billy nodded. He had heard the tale before, including the recital of
      the sainted 'Enery's gallant dash from the blazing palace in
      an effort to save Don Ricardo's only child, a girl of seven, and of
      his capture and subsequent execution.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That ended the revolution,&rdquo; Mother Jenks concluded. &ldquo;But
      'ere's somethink I've never told a livin' soul.
      Shortly before 'Enery was hexecuted, 'e told me where 'e'd
      'id the youngster&mdash;in a culvert out on the Malecon; so I
      'ired a four-wheeler an' went out an' rescued the pore
      lamb. She'd been 'idin' there thirty-six hours an'
      was well-nigh dead, an' as there ain't no tellin' what a
      mob o' these spiggoties 'll do when they're excited, I
      'id 'er until the harrival o' the next fruit steamer, w'en
      I shipped 'er to New Orleans in care o' the stewardess. Hi
      'ad 'er put in the Catholic convent there, for as 'Enery
      said: ''Enrietta, keep an eye on the little nipper, an'
      do yer damndest to see she's raised a lydy. 'Er father was a
      gentleman, an' you never want to forget 'e made you Mrs.
      Colonel Jenks.' So Hi've made a lydy out o' her, Willie:
      education, pianner lessons, paintin', singin', an'
      deportmint. After she graduated from the convent, I 'ad her take a
      course in the Uniwersity o' California&mdash;New Orleans wasn't
      'ealthy for'er, an' she needed a chynge o' climate&mdash;an'
      for the last two years she's been teachin' in the 'igh
      school in Los Angeles.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you haven't seen her in all these years?&rdquo; Geary
      demanded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not a look, Willie. She's been after me ever since she
      graduated from the convent to let her come 'ome an' wisit me,
      but Hi've told'er to wyte&mdash;that I'd be comin'
      soon to wisit her. An' now, s'help me, she won't wait no
      longer; she's cornin' to wisit me! Gor', Willie, she's
      on her w'y!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So this cablegram would indicate,&rdquo; Geary observed. &ldquo;Nevertheless,
      Mother, I'm at a loss to know why you should feel so cut up over the
      impending visit.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      There was real fear in Mother Jenks's tear-dimmed eyes. &ldquo;I
      cawn't let'er see me,&rdquo; she wailed. &ldquo;I wasn't
      this w'y w'en my sainted 'Enery hentrusted the lamb to
      me; it wasn't until awfter they hexecuted 'Enery that I
      commenced to slip&mdash;an' now look at me. Look at me, Willie
      Geary; look at me, I s'y. Wot do yer see? Aw, don't tell me I'm
      young an' 'andsome, for I knows wot I am. I'm a frowsy,
      drunken, disreputable baggage, with no heducation or nothink. I've
      raised'er a lydy on account of 'er bein' born a lydy an'
      her father bein' good to me an my 'Enery&mdash;an' all
      along, hever since she learned to write me a letter, I've been
      'Enrietta Wilkins to'er, an' Mother Jenks to every
      beach-combin' beggar in the Caribbean tropics. I've lied to'er,
      Willie. I've wrote 'er as 'ow 'er fawther, before
      'e died, give me enough money to heducate'er like a lydy&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Again Mother Jenks's grief overcame her. &ldquo;An' wot lovin'
      letters my darlin' writes me,&rdquo; she sobbed. &ldquo;Calls me
      'er lovin' Aunt 'Enrietta, an' me&mdash;Gor',
      Willie, I ain't respectable. She's comin' to see me&mdash;an'
      I cawn't let'er. She mustn't know 'ow I got the
      money for 'er heducation&mdash;sellin' 'ell-fire to a
      pack of rotten dorgs an' consortin' with the scum of this
      stinkin' 'ole! Oh, Willie, you've got to 'elp me.
      I cawn't 'ave'er comin' to El Buen Amigo to see
      me, an' I cawn't ruin 'er reputation by callin' on
      'er in public at the 'Otel Mateo. Oh, Gor', Willie,
      Mother's come a cropper.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Willie agreed with her. He patted the sinful gray head of his landlady and
      waited for her to regain her composure, the while he racked his agile
      brain for a feasible plan to fit the emergency. He realized it would be
      quite useless to argue Mother Jenks into the belief that she might pull
      herself together, so to speak, and run the risk of meeting with her ward;
      for the old woman had been born in the slums of London and raised a
      barmaid. She knew her place. She was not a lady and could never hope now
      to associate with one, even in a menial capacity, so there was an end to
      it! During the past fifteen years, the lower Mother Jenks had sunk in the
      social scale, even of free-and-easy old Buenaventura, the higher had she
      raised the one sweet note in her sordid life; not until the arrival of
      that cablegram did she realize that during those fifteen years she had
      been raising a barrier between her and the object of her stifled maternal
      yearnings&mdash;a barrier which, to her class-controlled mind, could never
      be swept away.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She's been picturin' me in 'er mind all these
      years, Willie&mdash;picturin' a fraud,&rdquo; wailed Mother Jenks.
      &ldquo;If she sees me now, wot a shock she'll get, pore sweetheart&mdash;an'
      'er the spittin' himage of a hangel. And oh, Willie, while she
      don't remember wot I looked like, think o' the shock if she
      meets me! In 'er lawst letter she said as 'ow I was the only
      hanchor she had in life. Ho, yes. A sweet-lookin' hanchor I am&mdash;an'
      Hi was 'opin' to die before she found hout. I've got a
      hanuerism in my 'eart, Willie, so the surgeon on the mail boat tells
      me, an' w'en I go, I'll go like&mdash;that!&rdquo;
      Mother Jenks snapped her cigarette-stained fingers. &ldquo;I 'ad the
      doctor come ashore the last time <i>La Estrellita</i> was in, on account o'
      'im bein' a Hamerican an' up to snuff. An' Hi've
      got 'ardenin' of the harteries, too. I'm fifty-seven,
      Willie, an' since my sainted 'Enery passed away, I 'aven't
      been no bloomin' hangel.&rdquo; She wrung her hands. &ldquo;Oh, w'y
      in 'ell couldn't them harteries 'ave busted in time to
      save my lamb the 'umiliatin' knowledge that she's be'oldin'
      to the likes o' me for wot she's got&mdash;an' 'ow
      I got it for'er.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Billy Geary had a bright idea. &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;why not
      die&mdash;temporarily&mdash;if you feel that way about it? You could come
      back from the grave after she's gone.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      But Mother Jenks shook her head. &ldquo;No,&rdquo; she declared. &ldquo;While
      Dolores is self-supportin' now, still, if anythink 'appened an'
      she was to need 'elp, 'elp is somethin' no ghost can
      give. Think again, Willie. Gor', lad, w'ere's yer brains&mdash;an'
      you with your stummick filled to bustin' with a breakfast fit for a
      knight o' the bawth.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; Billy countered thoughtfully, &ldquo;apparently there's
      no way of heading her off before she takes the steamer at New Orleans, so
      we'll take it for granted she'll arrive here in due course.
      About the time she's due, suppose you run up to San Miguel de Padua
      for a couple of weeks and leave me to run El Buen Amigo in your absence. I'll
      play fair with you, Mother, so help me. I'll account for every <i>centavo</i>.
      I'll borrow some decent clothes from Leber the day the steamer gets
      in; then I'll go aboard and look over the passenger-list, and if she's
      aboard, I'll tell her you closed your house and started for
      California to visit her on the last northbound steamer&mdash;that her
      cablegram arrived just after you had started; that the cable company,
      knowing I am a friend of yours, showed me the message and that I took it
      upon myself to call and explain that as a result of your departure for the
      United States it will be useless for her to land&mdash;useless and
      dangerous, because cholera is raging in Buenaventura, although the port
      authorities deny it&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Willie,&rdquo; Mother Jenks interrupted impressively, a ghost of
      her old debonair spirit shining through her tears, &ldquo;yer don't
      owe me a bloomin' sixpence! Yer've syved the day, syved my
      reputation, an' syved a lydy's peace o' mind. Kiss me,
      yer precious byby.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      So Billy kissed her&mdash;gravely and with filial reverence, for he had
      long suspected Mother Jenks of being a pearl cast before swine, and now he
      was certain of it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'll send her back to the United States and promise to cable
      you to await her there,&rdquo; Billy continued. &ldquo;Of course, we can't
      help it if you and the cablegram miss connections, and once the young lady
      is back in the United States, I dare say she'll have to stay there a
      couple of years before she can save the price of another sea voyage. And
      in the meantime she may marry&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Or that haneurism or my bally harteries may 'ave turned the
      trick before that,&rdquo; Mother Jenks suggested candidly but joyously.
      &ldquo;In course she'll be disappointed, but then disappointment
      never lays 'eavy on a young 'eart, Willie; an' bein'
      disappointed at not seein' a person you ain't really
      acquainted with ain't as bad as some disappointments.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I guess I know,&rdquo; Billy Geary replied bitterly. &ldquo;If that
      cablegram had only been for me! The only thing worth while I have done in
      my twenty-six years of life was to accumulate the best friend a man ever
      had&mdash;and lose him again because I was a fool and couldn't
      understand things without a blueprint! Mother, if my old partner could, by
      some miracle, manage to marry this Dolores girl, your arteries and your
      aneurisms might bust and be damned, but the girl would be safe.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;M'ybe,&rdquo; Mother Jenks suggested hopefully, &ldquo;yer
      might fix it up for her w'en I'm gone. From all haccounts
      'e's no-end a gentleman.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He's a he-man,&rdquo; Mr. Geary declared with conviction. He
      sighed. &ldquo;John Stuart Webster, wherever you are, please write or
      cable,&rdquo; he murmured.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER IX
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">T</span>HE ancient bromide
      to the effect that man proposes but God disposes was never better
      exemplified than in the case of John Stuart Webster, who, having
      formulated certain daring plans for the morrow and surrendered himself to
      grateful slumber in his stateroom aboard the Gulf States Limited, awoke on
      that momentous morn to a distinct apprehension that all was not as it
      should be with him. His mouth reminded him vaguely of a bird-and-animal
      store, and riot and insurrection had broken out in the geometric centre of
      his internal economy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I believe I'm going to be too ill to eat breakfast,&rdquo; he
      told himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      By seven o'clock this apprehension had crystallized into certainty.
      Webster had spent much of his life far from civilization, and as a result
      had found it necessary to acquire more than the layman's knowledge
      of rough-and-tumble surgery and the ordinary ills to which mortal is heir;
      consequently he was sufficient of a jack-leg doctor to suspect he was
      developing a splendid little case of ptomaine poisoning. He was aided in
      reaching this conclusion by memories of the dinner his friends had given
      him the night before, and at which he had partaken of a mallard duck,
      killed out of season and therefore greatly to be prized. He recalled the
      waiter's boast that the said duck had been hung for five days and
      had reached that state of ripeness and tenderness so greatly desired by
      those connoisseurs of food whose fool philosophy has been responsible for
      more deaths than most doctors. .
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That brute of a duck was too far gone,&rdquo; Mr. Webster
      soliloquized bitterly. &ldquo;And to think I'm killed off in the
      mere shank of my celebration, just because I got so rich and stuck-up I
      had to tie into some offal to show what a discerning judgment I had in
      food, not to mention my distinctive appetite. I ought to be knocked on the
      head with something, and I hope I may be if I ever accept any man's
      judgment in opposition to my own, on the subject of ripe mallards. This is
      what comes of breaking the game laws.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He decided presently to go into executive session with the sleeping-car
      conductor, who wired ahead for a doctor to meet the train at the next
      station. And when the sawbones came and pawed Jack Webster over, he
      gravely announced that if the patient had the slightest ambition to vote
      at the next Presidential election, he should leave the train at St. Louis
      and enter a hospital forthwith. To this heart-breaking program Webster
      entered not the slightest objection, for when a man is seriously ill, he
      is in much the same position as a politician&mdash;to wit: he is in the
      hands of his friends. A sick man is always very sick&mdash;or thinks he
      is, which amounts to the same thing; and as a rule he thinks of little
      else save how sick he is. John S. Webster was, in this respect, neither
      better nor worse than others of his sex, and in his great bodily and
      mental depression his plans of the night before for getting acquainted
      with Dolores Ruey occurred to him now as something extremely futile and
      presumptuous. That young lady was now the subject least in his mind, for
      she was at most naught but a bright day-dream; whereas his friend Billy
      Geary was down in Sobrante with a rich wildcat mine waiting to be
      developed, while the source of development lay on a bed of pain assailed
      by secret apprehensions that all was over!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Poor Billy-boy!&rdquo; the sufferer murmured. &ldquo;He'll
      wait and wait, and his old Jack-partner won't come! Damn that duck!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He had one little stab of pain higher up, and around his heart, as they
      carried him off the train at St. Louis and stowed him in an ambulance
      thoughtfully provided for by telegraph. In a nebulous way it occurred to
      him that Fate had again crossed her fingers when paradise loomed on the
      horizon; but recalling how very ill he was, he damned the duck. He told
      himself that even if he should survive (which wasn't possible),
      there could be no doubt in his mind, after all he had been through, that
      the good Lord had marked him for a loveless, friendless, childless man;
      that it was useless to struggle against the inevitable. He felt very, very
      sorry for himself as the orderlies tucked him into bed and a nurse thrust
      a thermometer under his tongue.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A hundred and four and a quarter,&rdquo; he heard her murmur to the
      doctor a few minutes later.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No bird ever flew so high that he didn't come down to roost,&rdquo;
      said Mr. Webster aloud.
    </p>
    <p>
      The doctor and the nurse exchanged knowing glances. They nodded. The
      patient was already delirious&mdash;a bad sign.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hey, Doc,&rdquo; the stricken man called. They bent over him.
      &ldquo;Send&mdash;cablegram to Billy Geary&mdash;tell him&mdash;come home&mdash;before
      that thousand&mdash;spent&mdash;money&mdash;my pocket.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I hear you,&rdquo; the nurse said soothingly. &ldquo;And the
      address?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Calle de Concordia, Nineteen, Buenaventura, Sobrante.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Say it again,&rdquo; the nurse urged him. &ldquo;Spell it.&rdquo;
      Poor girl! She was a native of St. Louis. If Jack Webster had mentioned
      Ossawatomie or Canandaigua, he would not have been called upon to go into
      details and waste his strength. He gasped and wet his lips; she bent to
      get the message:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Damn that duck,&rdquo; he whispered. &ldquo;She had a green
      tailor-made suit, and&mdash;believe me, girl, I'd rather sell my
      Death Valley&mdash;borax-claims than&mdash;work them myself. Free-milling
      gold&mdash;catch it on amalgamating plates&mdash;contact between andesite
      and&mdash;Silurian limestone&mdash;Billy knows ducks. I taught him myself.
      Come, Neddy. All together now, you old&mdash;pelican. A little close
      harmony, boys:
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      &ldquo;Let go the peak halyards,
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      Let go the peak halyards,
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      My finger is caught in the block!
    </p>
    <p class="indent30">
      Leggo!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sounds like a drinking man,&rdquo; the doctor observed. &ldquo;If
      that's the case, this attack will go hard with him.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      It did. However, life had the habit of going hard with Webster so
      frequently that fortunately he was trained to the minute, and after three
      days of heroic battling the doctor awarded Jack the decision. Thereafter
      they kept him in the hospital ten days longer, &ldquo;feeding him up&rdquo;
      as the patient expressed it&mdash;at the end of which period Webster, some
      fifteen pounds lighter and not quite so fast on his feet as formerly,
      resumed his journey toward New Orleans.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the meantime, however, several things had happened. To begin, Dolores
      Ruey spent two days wondering what had become of her quondam knight of the
      whiskers&mdash;at the end of which period she arrived in New Orleans with
      the conviction strong upon her that while her hero might be as courageous
      as a wounded lion when dealing with men, he was the possessor, when
      dealing with women, of about two per cent, less courage than a cottontail
      rabbit. She reproached herself for the wintry glance she had cast upon the
      poor fellow that night at the Denver railway station; she decided that the
      amazing Neddy Jerome was an interfering, impudent old fool and that she
      had done an unmaidenly and brazen deed in replying to his ridiculous
      telegram, even though she did so under an assumed name. Being a very human
      young lady, however, she could not help wondering what had become of the
      ubiquitous Mr. Webster, although the fact that he had mysteriously
      disappeared from the train en route to New Orleans did not perturb her one
      half so much as it had the disappearee! She had this advantage over that
      unfortunate man. Whereas he did not know she was bound for Buenaventura,
      she knew he was; hence, upon arrival in New Orleans she dismissed him from
      her thoughts, serene in abiding faith that sooner or later her knight
      would appear, like little <i>Bo-Peep's</i> lost sheep, dragging his
      tail behind him, so to speak. The only regret she entertained arose from
      her disappointment in the knowledge of his real character, and its wide
      variance from the heroic attributes with which she had endowed him. She
      had depended upon him to be a daring devil&mdash;and he had failed to toe
      the scratch!
    </p>
    <p>
      Dolores spent a week in New Orleans renewing schoolgirl friendships from
      her convent days in the quaint old town. This stop-over, together with the
      one in Denver, not having been taken into consideration by Mr. William
      Geary when he and Mother Jenks commenced to speculate upon the approximate
      date of her arrival in Buenaventura, resulted in the premature flight of
      Mother Jenks to San Miguel de Padua, a fruitless visit on the part of
      Billy aboard the <i>Cacique</i>, of the United Fruit Company's line,
      followed by a hurry call to Mother Jenks to return to Buenaventura until
      the arrival of the next steamer.
    </p>
    <p>
      This time Billy's calculations proved correct, for Dolores did
      arrive on that steamer. It is also worthy of remark here that shortly
      after boarding the vessel and while <i>La Estrellita</i> was snoring down
      the Mississippi, Miss Dolores did the missing Webster the signal honour of
      scanning the purser's passenger list in a vain search for his name.
    </p>
    <p>
      At Buenaventura the steamer anchored in the roadstead; the port doctor
      came aboard, partook of his customary drink with the captain, received a
      bundle of the latest American newspapers and magazines, nosed around,
      asked a few perfunctory questions, and gave the vessel pratique.
      Immediately she was surrounded by lighters manned by clamorous, half-naked
      Sobranteans, each screaming in a horrible patois of English, Spanish, and
      good American slang perfervid praises of the excellence of his service
      compared with that of his neighbour. Dolores was particularly interested
      in the antics of one fellow who had a sign tacked on a short signal mast
      in his lighter. &ldquo;I am a poor man with a large family, and my father
      was an American,&rdquo; the legend ran. &ldquo;Kind-hearted Americans will
      patronize me to the exclusion of all others.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Dolores had made up her mind to heed this pathetic appeal, when she
      observed a gasolene launch shoot up to the landing at the foot of the
      companion-ladder and discharge a well-dressed, youthful white man. As he
      came up the companion, the purser recognized him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Howdy, Bill,&rdquo; he called.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hello, yourself,&rdquo; Mr. William Geary replied, and Dolores knew
      him for an American. &ldquo;Do you happen to have as a passenger this trip
      a large, interesting person, by name John Stuart Webster?&rdquo; added
      Billy Geary.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't know, Billy. I'll look over the passenger-list.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No hope,&rdquo; Billy replied mournfully. &ldquo;If Jack Webster
      was aboard he'd have got acquainted with you. However, take a
      look-see to make certain.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Friend of yours?&rdquo; the purser queried.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You bet. Likewise guide and philosopher. He should have been here
      on the last steamer&mdash;cabled me he was coming, and I haven't
      heard a word from him since. I'm a little worried.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'll get the list,&rdquo; the purser announced, and together
      they moved off toward his office. Dolores followed, drawn by the mention
      of that magic name Webster, and paused in front of the purser's
      office to lean over the rail, ostensibly to watch the <i>cargadores</i> in
      their lighters clustering around the great ship, but in reality to learn
      more of the mysterious Webster.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Blast the luck,&rdquo; Billy Geary growled, &ldquo;the old sinner
      isn't here. Gosh, that's worse than having a note called on a
      fellow. By the way, do you happen to have a Miss Dolores Ruey aboard?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Dolores pricked up her little ears. What possible interest could this
      stranger have in her goings or comings?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You picked a winner this time, Bill,&rdquo; she heard the purser
      say. &ldquo;Stateroom Sixteen, boat-deck, starboard side. You'll
      probably find her there, packing to go ashore.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thanks,&rdquo; Billy replied and stepped out of the purser's
      office. Dolores turned and faced him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am Miss Ruey,&rdquo; she announced. &ldquo;I heard you asking for
      me.&rdquo; Her eyes carried the query she had not put into words: &ldquo;Who
      are you, and what do you want?&rdquo; Billy saw and understood, and on the
      instant a wave of desolation surged over him.
    </p>
    <p>
      So this was the vision he had volunteered to meet aboard <i>La Estrellita</i>,
      and by specious lie and hypo-critic mien, turn her back from the portals
      of Buenaventura to that dear old United States, which, Billy suddenly
      recalled with poignant pain, is a sizable country in which a young lady
      may very readily be lost forever. At the moment it occurred to Mr. Geary
      that the apotheosis of rapture would be a midnight stroll in the moonlight
      along the Malecon, with the little waves from the Caribbean lapping and
      gurgling against the beach, while afar, in some bosky retreat, a harp with
      a flute obbligato sobbed out &ldquo;'Nita, Juanita&rdquo; or some
      equally heart-throb ballad. Yes, that would be quite a joyous journey&mdash;with
      Dolores Ruey.
    </p>
    <p>
      Billy, with the quick eye of youth, noted that Dolores was perfectly
      wonderful in a white flannel skirt and jacket, white buck boots, white
      panama hat with a gorgeous puggaree, a mannish little linen collar, and a
      red four-in-hand tie. From under that white hat peeped a profusion of
      crinkly brown hair with a slightly reddish tinge to it; her eyes were big
      and brown and wide apart, with golden flecks in them; their glance met
      Billy's hungry gaze simply, directly, and with 'a curiosity
      there was no attempt to hide. Her complexion was that peculiar shade of
      olive, with a warm, healthy, underlying tinge that nobody could possibly
      hope to describe, but which fits in so beautifully with brown eyes of a
      certain shade. Her nose was patrician; her beautiful short upper lip
      revealed the tips of two perfect, milk-white front teeth: she was, Billy
      Geary told himself, a goddess before whom all low, worthless, ornery
      fellows like himself should grovel and die happy, if perchance she might
      be so minded as to walk on their faces! He was aroused from his critical
      inventory when the houri spoke again:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You haven't answered my question, sir!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Billy, &ldquo;I didn't. Stupid of me, too. I
      was staring, instead&mdash;because, you see, it isn't often we poor
      expatriated devils down here climb out of Hades long enough to view the
      angels! However, come to think of it, you didn't ask me any
      question. You looked it. My name is Geary&mdash;William H. Geary, by
      profession a mining engineer and by nature an ignoramus, and I have called
      to deliver some disappointing news regarding Henrietta Wilkins.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is she&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She is very much alive and in excellent health&mdash;or rather was,
      the last time it was my pleasure and privilege to call on the dear lady.
      But she isn't in Buenaventura now.&rdquo; Mentally Billy asked God
      to forgive him his black-hearted treachery to this winsome girl. He
      loathed the task he had planned and foisted upon himself, and nothing but
      the memory of Mother Jenks's manifold kindnesses to him in a day,
      thanks to Jack Webster, now happily behind him, could have induced him to
      go through to the finish. Mentally clinging to the memory of his
      obligations to Mother Jenks, Billy ruthlessly smothered his finer
      instincts and with breaking heart prepared to do or die.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, where is she?&rdquo; Dolores queried, and Billy could have
      wept at the fright in those lovely brown eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      He waved his hand airily. &ldquo;<i>Quien sabe?</i>&rdquo; he said.
      &ldquo;She left three weeks ago for New Orleans to visit you. I dare say
      you passed each other on the road&mdash;here, here, Miss Ruey, don't
      cry. By golly, this is a tough one, I know, but be brave and we'll
      save something out of the wreck yet.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He took a recess of three minutes, while Dolores dabbed her eyes and went
      through sundry other motions of being brave. Then he proceeded with his
      nefarious recital.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When your cablegram arrived, Miss Ruey, naturally Mrs. Wilkins was
      not here to receive it, and as I was the only person who had her address,
      the cable-agent referred it to me. Under the circumstances, not knowing
      where I could reach you with a cable informing you that Mrs. Wilkins was
      headed for California to see you, I had no other alternative but let
      matters take their course. I decided you might arrive on <i>La Estrellita</i>,
      so I called to welcome you to our thriving little city, and, as a friend
      of about two minutes' standing, to warn you away from it.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Billy's mien, as he voiced this warning, was so singularly
      mysterious that Dolores's curiosity was aroused instantly and rose
      superior to her grief. &ldquo;Why, what's the matter?&rdquo; she
      demanded.
    </p>
    <p>
      Billy looked around, as if fearful of being overheard. He lowered his
      voice. &ldquo;We're going to have one grand little first-class
      revolution,&rdquo; he replied. &ldquo;It's due to bust almost any
      night now, and when it does, the streets of San Buenaventura will run red
      with blood. I shudder to think of the fate that might befall you, alone
      and unprotected in the city, in such event.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Dolores blanched. &ldquo;Oh, dearie me,&rdquo; she quavered. &ldquo;Do
      they still have revolutions here? You know, Mr. Geary, my poor father was
      killed in one.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, and the same old political gang that shot him is still on
      deck,&rdquo; Billy warned her. &ldquo;It would be highly dangerous for a
      Ruey, man or woman, to show his or her nose around Buenaventura about now.
      Besides, Miss Ruey, that isn't the worst,&rdquo; he continued, for a
      whole-hearted lad was Billy, who never did anything by halves. While he
      was opposed to lies and liars on broad, general principles, nevertheless
      whenever the exigencies of circumstance compelled him to backslide, his
      Hibernian impulsiveness bade him spin a yarn worth while. &ldquo;The city
      is reeking with cholera,&rdquo; he declared.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Cholera!&rdquo; Dolores's big brown eyes grew Digger with
      wonder and concern. &ldquo;Are there any other fatal diseases prevalent,
      Mr. Geary?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, we're not advertising it, Miss Ruey, but if I had an
      enemy to whom I wanted to slip a plain or fancy case of bubonic plague, I'd
      invite him to visit me at Buenaventura.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How strange the port authorities didn't warn us at New
      Orleans!&rdquo; Dolores suggested.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tish! Tush! Fiddlesticks and then some. The fruit company censors
      everything, Miss Ruey, and the news doesn't get out. The port
      authorities here would never admit the truth of such reports, because it
      would be bad for business&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But the port doctor just said the passengers could go ashore.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What's a human life to a doctor? Besides, he's on the
      slush-fund pay-roll and does whatever the higher-ups tell him. You be
      guided by what I tell you, Miss Ruey, and do not set foot on Sobrantean
      soil. Even if you had a guarantee that you could escape alive, there isn't
      a hotel in the city you could afford to sleep in; Miss Wilkins's
      house is closed up, and Miss Wilkins's servants dismissed, and&mdash;er&mdash;well,
      if you stay aboard <i>La Estrellita</i>, you'll have your nice clean
      stateroom, your well-cooked meals, your bath, and the attentions of the
      stewardess. The steamer will be loaded in two days; then you go back to
      New Orleans, and by the time you arrive there I'll have been in
      communication by cable with Mother Jenks&mdash;I mean&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mother who?&rdquo; Dolores demanded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A mere slip of the tongue, Miss Ruey. I was thinking of my
      landlady. I meant Mrs. Wilkins&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You mean Miss Wilkins,&rdquo; Dolores corrected him smilingly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So I do. Of course, Miss Wilkins. Well, I'll cable her you're
      on your way back, and if you'll leave me your New Orleans address, I'll
      have her get in touch with you, and then you can have your nice little
      visit far from the madding crowd's ignoble strife and the
      death-dealing sting of the yellow-fever mosquito.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm so awfully obliged to you, Mr. Geary. You're so
      kind, I'm sure I'd be a most ungrateful girl not to be guided
      by you accordingly. You wouldn't risk any friend of yours in this
      terrible place, would you, Mr. Geary?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Indeed, I would not. By permitting anybody I thought anything of to
      come to this city, I should feel guilty of murder.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm sure you would, Mr. Geary. Nevertheless, there is one
      point that is not quite clear in my mind, and I wish you'd explain&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Command me, Miss Ruey.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If this is such a frightful place, why are you so anxious, if I may
      employ such language, to hornsgoggle your dearest friend, Mr. John S.
      Webster, into coming down here? Do you want to kill him and get his money&mdash;or
      what?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Billy's face flamed at thought of the embarrassing trap his glib
      tongue had led him into. He cursed himself for a star-spangled jackass,
      and while he was engaged in this interesting pastime Dolores spoke again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And by the way, which is it? Miss Wilkins or Mrs.? You've
      called her both, and when I reminded you she was a Miss, you agreed with
      me, whereas she is nothing of the sort. She's a Mrs. Then you
      blurted out something about a Mother Jenks, and finally, Mr. Geary, it
      occurs to me that for a complete stranger you are unduly interested in my
      welfare. I'm not such a goose as to assimilate your weird tales of
      death from disease. I might have accepted the revolution, because I know
      it's the national outdoor sport down here, and I might have accepted
      the cholera, because it wouldn't surprise me; but when you so
      artlessly throw in bubonic plague and yellow fever for good measure, Mr.
      Geary, you tax my credulity. It occurs to me that if your friend John S.
      Webster can risk Buenaventura, I can also.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&mdash;you know that old tarantula?&rdquo; Billy gasped. &ldquo;Why
      I&mdash;I came out to warn him off the grass, too.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Dolores walked a step closer to Billy and eyed him disapprovingly. &ldquo;I'm
      so sorry I can't believe that statement,&rdquo; she replied. &ldquo;With
      the exception of your tendency toward fiction, you're rather a
      presentable young man, too. It's really too bad, but it happens that
      I was standing by the companion-ladder when you came aboard and spoke to
      the purser; when you asked him if Mr. Webster was aboard, your face was
      alight with eagerness and anticipation, but when you had reason to believe
      he was not aboard, you looked so terribly disappointed I felt sorry for
      you.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, of course I would have been delighted to meet the old boy,&rdquo;
      Billy began, but she interrupted him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Geary, you're about as reliable as a Los Angeles
      thermometer&mdash;and if you've ever lived in a town the main asset
      of which is climate, you know just how reliable you are. Now, let us
      understand each other, Mr. Geary: If you think I'm the kind of
      simple, trusting little country maid who would come within half a mile of
      the land of her birth and then run back home because somebody said 'Boo!'
      you are not nearly so intelligent as you look. I'm going ashore, if
      it's the last act of my life, and when I get there I'm going
      to interview the cable agent; then I'm going to call at the
      steamship office and scan the passenger list of the last three north-bound
      steamers, and if I do not find Henrietta Wilkins's name on one of
      those passenger lists I'm going up to Calle de Concordia Number
      Nineteen&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I surrender unconditionally,&rdquo; groaned Billy. &ldquo;I'm
      a liar from beginning to end. I overlooked my hand. I forgot that while
      you were born in this country and bred from several generations of
      Sobranteans, you were raised in the U. S. A. I beg of you to believe me,
      however, when I tell you that I only told you those whoppers because I was
      in honour bound to tell them. Personally, I don't want you to go
      away&mdash;at least, not until I'm ready to go away, too! Miss Ruey,
      my nose is in the dust. On my lying head there is a ton of ashes and a
      thousand running yards of sackcloth. There is a fever in my brain and a
      misery in my heart&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And contrition in your face,&rdquo; she interrupted him laughingly.
      &ldquo;You're forgiven, Mr. Geary&mdash;on one condition.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Name it,&rdquo; he answered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tell me everything from beginning to end.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      So Billy told her, for there are some women in this world to whom a man
      with a poker face, the imagination of a Verne, and the histrionic art of
      an Irving cannot&mdash;nay, dare not&mdash;tell a lie. &ldquo;I would much
      rather have been visited with a plague of boils, like our old friend, the
      late Job, than have to tell you this, Miss Ruey,&rdquo; Bill concluded his
      recital. &ldquo;Man proposes, but God disposes, and you're here and
      bound to learn the truth sooner or later. Mother isn't a lady and
      she knows it, but take it from me, Miss Ruey, she's a grand old
      piece of work. She's a scout&mdash;a ring-tailed sport&mdash;a
      regular individual and game as a gander.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In other words,&rdquo; Dolores replied smilingly, &ldquo;she has a
      heart of gold.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Twenty-four carat, all wool and a yard wide,&rdquo; Billy declared,
      mixed-metaphorically.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And I mustn't call at El Buen Amigo, Mr. Geary?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perish the thought! Mother must call on you. El Buen Amigo is what
      you might term a hotel for tropical tramps of the masculine sex. Nearly
      all of Mother's guests have a past, you know. They're the
      submerged white tenth of Sobrante.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then my benefactor must call to see me here?&rdquo; Billy nodded.
      &ldquo;When will you bring her here?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Billy reflected that Mother Jenks had been up rather late the night before
      and that trade in the <i>cantina</i> of El Buen Amigo had been unusually
      brisk; so since he desired to exhibit the old lady at her best, he
      concluded it might be well to spar for wind.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To-morrow at ten,&rdquo; he declared. Dolores inclined her head.
      Something told her she had better leave all future details to the amiable
      William.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I take it you are a guest at El Buen Amigo, Mr. Geary,&rdquo; she
      continued.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, yes. I've been a guest for about two weeks now; before
      that I was an encumbrance. Now I'm paying my way&mdash;thanks to an
      old side-kicker of mine, Jack Webster.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But surely you're not a tropical tramp, Mr. Geary?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was, but Jack Webster reformed me,&rdquo; Billy answered
      quizzically. &ldquo;You know&mdash;power of wealth and all that.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I remember you inquired for your friend Mr. Webster when you came
      aboard the steamer.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I remember it, too,&rdquo; Billy countered ruefully. &ldquo;I can't
      imagine what's become of him. I suppose I'll have a cable from
      him any day, though, telling me he'll be along on the next steamer.
      Miss Ruey, did you ever go to meet the only human being in the world and
      discover that for some mysterious reason he had failed to keep the
      appointment? If you ever have, you'll know just how cheerful I felt
      when I didn't find Jack's name on the passenger list. Miss
      Ruey, you'll have to meet old John Stuart the minute he lights in
      Buenaventura. He's some boy.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>Old</i> John Stuart?&rdquo; she queried. &ldquo;How old?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, thirty-nine or forty on actual count, but one of the kind that
      will live to be a thousand and then have to be killed with an axe. He's
      coming to Sobrante to help me put over a mining deal.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How interesting, Mr. Geary! No wonder you were disappointed.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The last sentence was a shaft deliberately launched; to Dolores's
      delight it made a keyhole in Billy Geary's heart.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don't get me wrong, Miss Ruey,&rdquo; he hastened to assure
      her. &ldquo;I have a good mine, but I'd trade it for a hand-shake
      from Jack! The good Lord only published one edition of Jack, and limited
      the edition to one volume; then the plates were melted for the junk we
      call the human race.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, do tell me all about him,&rdquo; Dolores pleaded. Billy, always
      interested in his favourite topic, beamed with boyish pleasure. &ldquo;No,&rdquo;
      he said, &ldquo;I'll not tell you about him, Miss Ruey. I'll
      just let him speak for himself. We used to be as close to each other as
      peas in a pod, back in Colorado, and then I made a monkey of myself and
      shook old Jack without even saying good-bye. Miss Ruey, my action didn't
      even dent his friendship for me. Two weeks ago, when I was sick and
      penniless and despairing, the possessor of a concession on a fortune but
      without a <i>centavo</i> in my pockets to buy a banana, when I was a
      veritable beach-comber and existing on the charity of Mother Jenks, I
      managed finally to communicate with old Jack and told him where I was and
      what I had. There's his answer, Miss Ruey, and I'm not ashamed
      to say that when I got it I cried like a kid.&rdquo; And Billy handed her
      John Stuart Webster's remarkable cablegram, the receipt of which
      had, for Billy Geary, transformed night into day, purgatory into paradise.
      Dolores read it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No wonder you love him,&rdquo; she declared, and added artlessly:
      &ldquo;His wife must simply adore him.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'He has no wife to bother his fife, so he paddles his own
      canoe,'&rdquo; Billy recited. &ldquo;I don't believe the old
      sour-dough has ever been in love with anything more charming than the
      goddess of fortune. He's womanproof.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;About Mrs. Jenks,&rdquo; Dolores continued, abruptly changing the
      subject. &ldquo;How nice to reflect that after she had trusted you and
      believed in you when you were penniless, you were enabled to justify her
      faith.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You bet!&rdquo; Billy declared. &ldquo;I feel that I can never
      possibly hope to catch even with the old Samaritan, although I did try to
      show her how much I appreciated her.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I dare say you went right out and bought her an impossible hat,&rdquo;
      Dolores challenged roguishly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, I didn't&mdash;for a very sufficient reason. Down here
      the ladies do not wear hats. But I'll tell you what I did buy her,
      Miss Ruey&mdash;and oh, by George. I'm glad now I did it. She'll
      wear them to-morrow when I bring her to see you. I bought her a new black
      silk dress and an old lace collar, and a gold breast-pin and a
      tortoise-shell hair comb and hired an open carriage and took her for an
      evening ride on the Malecon to listen to the band concert.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did she like that?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She ate it up,&rdquo; Billy declared with conviction. &ldquo;I
      think it was her first adventure in democracy.&rdquo; Billy's pulse
      was still far from normal when he reached El Buen Amigo, for he was
      infused with a strange, new-found warmth that burned like malarial fever
      but wasn't. He wasted no preliminaries on Mother Jenks, but bluntly
      acquainted her with the facts in the case.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mother Jenks eyed him a moment wildly. &ldquo;Gord's truth!&rdquo;
      she gasped; she reached for her favourite elixir, but Billy got the bottle
      first.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing doing,&rdquo; he warned this strange publican. &ldquo;Mother,
      you're funking it&mdash;and what would your sainted 'Enery say
      to that? Do you want that angel to kiss you and get a whiff of this
      brandy?&rdquo; Mother Jenks's eyes actually popped. &ldquo;Gor',
      Willie,&rdquo; she gasped, &ldquo;'aven't Hi told yer she's
      a lydy! Me kiss the lamb! Hi trusts, Mr. Geary, as ow I knows my plyce an'
      can keep it.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I know,&rdquo; Billy soothed the frightened old woman, &ldquo;but
      the trouble is Miss Dolores doesn't know hers&mdash;and something
      tells me if she does, she'll forget it. She'll take you in her
      arms and kiss you, sure as death and taxes.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      And she did! &ldquo;My lamb, my lamb,&rdquo; sobbed Mother Jenks the next
      morning, and rested her old cheek, with its rum-begotten hue, close to the
      rose-tinted ivory cheek of her ward. &ldquo;Me&mdash;wot I am&mdash;an'
      to think&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You're a sweet old dear,&rdquo; Dolores whispered, patting
      the gray head; &ldquo;and I'm going to call you Mother.&rdquo;

    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. William H. Geary,&rdquo; the girl remarked that night, &ldquo;I
      know now why your friend Mr. Webster sent that cablegram. I think you're
      a scout, too.&rdquo;

    <p>
      For reasons best known to himself Mr. Geary blushed furiously. &ldquo;I&mdash;I'd
      better go and break the news to Mother,&rdquo; he suggested inanely. She
      held out her hand; and Billy, having been long enough in Sobrante to have
      acquired the habit, bent his malarial person over that hand and kissed it.
      As he went out it occurred to him that had the lobby of the Hotel Mateo
      been paved with eggs, he must have floated over them like a Wraith, so
      light did he feel within.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER X
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">W</span>EBSTER reached New
      Orleans at the end of the first leg of his journey, to discover that in
      the matter of sailings he was not fortunate. He was one day late to board
      the <i>Atlanta</i>&mdash;a banana boat of the Consolidated Fruit Company's
      line plying regularly between New Orleans and that company's depots
      at Limon and San Buenaventura&mdash;which necessitated a wait of three
      days for the steamer <i>La Estrellita</i> of the Caribbean Mail Line,
      running to Caracas and way ports.
    </p>
    <p>
      This delay annoyed him, for he was the kind of man who, once he has made
      up his mind to embark upon a venture, is impatient to be up and doing.
      Accordingly, he decided to visit the ticket office of the Caribbean Mail
      Line immediately and avoid the rush in case the travel should be heavy&mdash;in
      which event a delay of an hour might be fatal&mdash;for should he be
      informed that the space on La Estrellita was entirely sold out, the
      knowledge would, he knew, set his reason tottering on its throne.
    </p>
    <p>
      The steamship office was in Canal Street. Webster arrived there during the
      luncheon hour, due to which fact he found but one clerk on duty at the
      ticket counter when he entered. This clerk was waiting on two well-dressed
      and palpably low-bred sons of the tropics, to whom he had just displayed a
      passenger list which the two were scanning critically. Their interest in
      it was so obvious that unconsciously Webster peeped over their shoulders
      (no difficult task for one of his stature) and discovered it to be the
      passenger list of the steamer La Estrellita. They were conversing together
      in low tones and Webster, who had spent many years of his life following
      his profession in Mexico, recognized their speech as the bastard Spanish
      of the peon.
    </p>
    <p>
      The clerk glanced up, caught Webster's eye and nodded to indicate
      that he would attend him directly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No hurry, old timer,&rdquo; Webster told him, with the bluff,
      free-and-easy democracy of the man of broad, unkenned horizons. &ldquo;Just
      save a place on that passenger list for my John Hancock when our friends
      here have finished with it.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He sat down in the long wall seat and waited until the pair, having
      completed their scrutiny of the list, turned to pass out. He glanced at
      them casually.
    </p>
    <p>
      Theirs were faces ordinary enough south of the Rio Grande but not likely
      to pass unnoticed in a northern crowd. One was a tall thin man whose
      bloodshot eyes were inclined to &ldquo;pop&rdquo; a little&mdash;infallible
      evidence in the Latin-American that he is drinking more hard liquor than
      is good for him. He was smooth-shaven, of pronounced Indian type, and wore
      considerable expensive jewellery.
    </p>
    <p>
      His companion was plainly of the same racial stock, although Webster
      suspected him of a slight admixture of negro blood. He was short, stocky,
      and aggressive looking; like his companion, bejewelled and possessed of a
      thin, carefully cultivated mous, tache that seemed to consist of about
      nineteen hairs on one side and twenty on the other. Evidently once upon a
      time, as the story books have it, he had been shot. Webster suspected a
      Mauser bullet, fired at long range. It had entered his right cheek, just
      below the malar, ranged downward through his mouth and out through a fold
      of flabby flesh under his left jowl. It must have been a frightful wound,
      but it had healed well except at the point of entrance, where it had a
      tendency to pucker considerably, thus drawing the man's eyelid down
      on his cheek and giving to that visual organ something of the appearance
      of a bulldog's.
    </p>
    <p>
      Both men observed Webster's swift but intense appraisal of them, and
      he of the puckered eye&mdash;perhaps because he was the cynosure of that
      scrutiny and morbidly sensitive of his facial disfigurement&mdash;replied
      with a cool, sullen stare that was almost belligerent.
    </p>
    <p>
      Webster gazed after them whimsically as he approached the counter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'd hate to wake up some night and find that <i>hombre</i>
      with the puckered eye leaning over me. To what branch of the genus Greaser
      do those two horse-thieves belong?&rdquo; he queried.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Central America, I take it,&rdquo; the clerk answered. &ldquo;They
      appear interested in the names of passengers bound for Caribbean ports.
      Looking for a friend, I suppose.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hardly. I speak their kind of Spanish and a peon doesn't
      refer to his friends in the free-and-easy language these fellows employed.
      By the way,&rdquo; he continued, suddenly apprehensive, &ldquo;do you get
      much of that paraqueet travel on your line?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;About 80 per cent, of it is off colour, sir.&rdquo; Webster
      pondered the 80-per-cent, probability of being berthed in the same
      stateroom with one of these people and the prospect was as revolting to
      him as would be an uninvited negro guest at the dining table of a southern
      family. He had all a Westerner's hatred for the breed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I want a ticket to San Buenaventura,&rdquo; he informed the
      clerk, &ldquo;but I don't relish the idea of a Greaser in the same
      stateroom with Me. I wonder if you couldn't manage to fix me up with
      a stateroom all to myself, or at least arrange it so that in the event of
      company I'll draw a white man. I can stand a slovenly white man
      where a clean peon would be unbearable, although&mdash;peon or Caballero&mdash;these
      people are apt to be tarred with the same stick. I don't care for
      any of them in mine.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm sorry, sir, but I cannot guarantee you absolute privacy
      nor any kind of white man. It's pretty mixed travel to all Central
      American ports.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How many berths in your first-class staterooms?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Two.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Webster smiled brightly. He had found a way out of the difficulty. &ldquo;I'll
      buy 'em both, son,&rdquo; he announced.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I cannot sell you an entire stateroom, sir. It's against the
      orders of the company to sell two berths to one man. The travel is pretty
      brisk and it's hardly fair to the public, you know.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, suppose I buy one ticket for myself and the other for&mdash;well,
      for my valet, let us say. Of course,&rdquo; he added brightly, &ldquo;I
      haven't engaged the valet yet and even should I do so I wouldn't
      be at all surprised if the rascal missed the boat!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The clerk glanced at him with a slow smile, and pondered. &ldquo;Well,&rdquo;
      he said presently, &ldquo;it's a poor rule that hasn't its
      exception, and when it comes to killing cats, strangulation with a
      butter-ball isn't the only method. If you care to buy a ticket for
      your valet, I'm sure I shouldn't worry whether or not he
      catches the boat. If my records show that the space is sold of two men and
      the purser collects two tickets, I think you'll be pretty safe from
      intrusion.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To the harassed traveller,&rdquo; said Mr. Webster, &ldquo;a
      meeting with a gentleman of your penetration is as refreshing as a canteen
      of cool water in the desert. Shoot!&rdquo; and he produced a handful of
      gold.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will&mdash;provided I have one empty cabin,&rdquo; and the clerk
      turned from the counter to consult his record of berths already sold and
      others reserved but not paid for. Presently he faced Webster at the
      counter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The outlook is very blue,&rdquo; he announced. &ldquo;Every name on
      the passenger list has a preponderance of vowels in it. However, I have
      one berth in No. 34 reserved by a gentleman who was to call for it by two
      o'clock to-day.&rdquo; He looked at his watch. &ldquo;It is now a
      quarter of one. If the reservation isn't claimed promptly at two o'clock
      I shall cancel it and reserve for you both berths in that room. If you
      will be good enough to leave me your name and address I will telephone you
      after that hour. In the meantime, you may make reservation of the other
      berth in the same stateroom. I feel very confident that the reservation in
      No. 34 will not be called for, Mr.&mdash;er&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Webster&mdash;John S. Webster. You are very kind, indeed. I'm
      at the St. Charles.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Be there at a quarter after two, Mr. Webster, and you will hear
      from me promptly on the minute,&rdquo; the clerk assured him; whereupon
      Webster paid for one berth and departed for his hotel with a feeling that
      the clerk's report would be favourable.
    </p>
    <p>
      True to his promise, at precisely a quarter after two, the ticket clerk
      telephoned Webster at his hotel that the berth in No. 34 had been
      cancelled and the entire stateroom was now at his disposal.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you will be good enough to give me the name of your valet,&rdquo;
      he concluded, &ldquo;it will not be necessary for you to come down for
      your tickets, Mr. Webster. I will fill in both names on my passenger
      manifest and send the tickets to your hotel by messenger immediately. You
      can then sign the tickets&mdash;I have already signed them as witness&mdash;and
      pay the messenger.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I haven't engaged that valet as yet,&rdquo; Webster
      began, but the other interrupted cheerfully: &ldquo;What's the odds?
      He's going to miss the boat, anyhow. All I require is a name.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That ought to be a simple request to comply with. Let me see! If I
      had a valet I think I should want him to be called Andrew or Martin.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I read a book once, Mr. Webster, and the valet in that book was
      called Andrew Bowers.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bowers is a fine old English name. Let us seek no further. Andrew
      Bowers it is.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank you. All you have to do then is to remember to sign the name,
      Andrew Bowers, to one ticket. Don't forget your valet's name
      now, and ball everything up,&rdquo; and the clerk hung up, laughing.
    </p>
    <p>
      Half an hour later a boy from the steamship office arrived with the
      tickets, collected for them, and departed, leaving John Stuart Webster
      singularly pleased with himself and at peace with the entire world.

      CHAPTER XI
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">A</span> &ldquo;LARGE&rdquo;
      dinner at Antoine's that night (Webster had heard of Antoine's
      dinners, both large and small and was resolved not to leave New Orleans
      until he had visited the famous restaurant) and a stroll through the
      picturesque old French quarter and along the levee next day, helped to
      render his enforced stay in New Orleans delightful, interesting, and
      instructive. Webster was one of those distinctful individual types to whom
      a chamber of horrors would be productive of more enjoyment than the usual
      round of &ldquo;points of interest.&rdquo; Experience had demonstrated to
      him that such points usually are uninteresting and wearing on the
      imagination, for the reason that the tourist trappers and proprietors of
      automobile 'buses, who map out the tours have no imagination
      themselves. Consequently, Webster preferred to prowl around quietly on
      little tours of discovery, personally conducted by himself. The search for
      obscure restaurants of unquestioned merit was with him almost a mania, and
      since in quaint New Orleans the food and drink specialist finds his
      highest heaven, no cloud marked the serenity of his delightful
      peregrinations.
    </p>
    <p>
      The next day would be Sunday, and Webster planned an early morning visit
      to the old French market, around which still lingers much of the
      picturesque charm and colourful romance of a day that is done&mdash;that
      echo of yesterday, as it were, which has left upon New Orleans an
      individuality as distinct as that which the olden, golden, godless days
      have left upon San Francisco.
    </p>
    <p>
      He rose before six o'clock, therefore; found a taxi, with the driver
      sound asleep inside, at the curb in front of the hotel; gave the latter
      his instructions, and climbed in.
    </p>
    <p>
      It being Sunday morning New Orleans slept late. Save for the few early
      morning worshippers hurrying to mass&mdash;mostly servants in a hurry to
      return to their kitchens and cook breakfast&mdash;the streets were
      deserted. The languorous air of dawn was redolent of the perfume of
      orange, rose, and sweet olive; from the four comers of the old town the
      mellow chimes of the Catholic church bells pealed their sweet, insistent
      call to the faithful; an atmosphere of subtle peace and sanctity pervaded
      the silent streets and awoke in John Stuart Webster's heart a vague
      nostalgia.
    </p>
    <p>
      Perhaps it was because so much of his life had been spent in lonely
      mountain or desert camps, or perhaps it was because this taxi ride through
      the pleasant southern dawn was so typical of the swift passing of the
      youth which had gone from him before he had had an opportunity to taste,
      even moderately, of its joys and allurements. He sighed&mdash;a little
      regretful sigh.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's you, Johnny Webster,&rdquo; he told himself, &ldquo;breezing
      along through life like a tin-canned dog; f passing the sweet and the
      beautiful and battling with the harsh and unlovely; here to-day and gone
      to-morrow, a poor harried devil with your trunk on your back, a slave to
      the call of gold; restless, in a great hurry to get there and an equal
      hurry to leave for the new diggings, and all the time Life passes you by
      and you don't grab so much as a tail feather! On such a morn as this
      Eve entered the Garden of Eden, while I, consummate idiot, shut myself up
      in a taxi to watch a bill of expense run up on the clock, while sniffing
      myrrh and incense through this confounded window. I'll get out and
      walk!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He was opposite Jackson Square and the cloying sweetness of palmetto,
      palm, and fig burdened the air. Above the rumble of the taxi he could hear
      the distant babel of voices in the French market across the square, so he
      halted the taxicab, alighted, and handed the driver a bill.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I want to explore this square,&rdquo; he said. He had recognized it
      by the heroic statue of General Jackson peeping through the trees. &ldquo;I'll
      walk through the square Up the market, and you may proceed to the market
      and meet me there. Later we will return to the hotel.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The chauffeur nodded, and Webster, every fibre of his alert, healthy body
      once more tingling with the sheer joy of living, entered the square, found
      a path that wound its way through the shrubbery, and came out at length in
      the main pathway, close to the Jackson memorial statue.
    </p>
    <p>
      A Creole girl&mdash;starry-eyed, beautiful, rich with the glorious
      colouring of her race&mdash;passed him bound for the cathedral across the
      square, as Webster thought, for she carried a large prayer book on her
      arm. To Webster she seemed to fit perfectly into her surroundings, to lend
      to them the last, final touch of beauty, the apotheosis of peace, and
      again the nostalgic fever submerged the quiet joy with which he had
      approached his journey through the square. His glance followed the girl
      down the walk.
    </p>
    <p>
      Presently she halted. A young man rose from a bench where evidently he had
      been waiting for her, and bowed low, his hat clasped to his breast, as
      only a Frenchman or a Spanish grandee can bow. Webster saw the Creole girl
      turn to him with a little gesture of pleasure. She extended her hand and
      the young man kissed it with old-fashioned courtesy.
    </p>
    <p>
      John Stuart Webster knew now what was missing in his scheme of things, as
      with reverent and wistful eyes he watched their meeting.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Forty years old,&rdquo; he thought, &ldquo;and I haven't
      spoken to a dozen women that caused me a second thought, or who weren't
      postmistresses or biscuit shooters! Forty years old and I've never
      been in love! Spring time down that little path and Indian summer in my
      old fool heart. Why, I ought to be arrested for failure to live!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The lovers were walking slowly, arm in arm, back along the path by which
      the girl had come, so with a courtesy and gentleness that were innate in
      him, Webster stepped out of sight behind the statue of Old Hickory; for he
      did not desire, by his mere presence, to intrude a discordant note in the
      perfect harmony of those two human hearts. He knew they desired that
      sylvan path to themselves; that evidently they had sought their early
      morning tryst in the knowledge that the square was likely to be deserted
      at this hour. Therefore, to provoke selfconsciousness in them now savoured
      to John Stuart Webster of a high crime and misdemeanour, for which reason
      he was careful to keep General Jackson between himself and the lovers
      until they had gone by.
    </p>
    <p>
      The young man was speaking as they passed; his voice was rich, pleasant,
      vibrant with the earnestness of what he had to say: with a pretty little
      silver-mounted walking stick he slashed at spears of grass alongside the
      path; the girl was crying a little. Neither of them had seen him, so he
      entered a path that led from them at right angles.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had proceeded but a few feet along this trail when, through a break in
      the shrubbery ahead of him, he saw two men. They were crossing Webster's
      path and following a course paralleling that of the lovers in the broad
      main walk. Brief as was his glimpse of them, however, Webster instantly
      recognized the two Central Americans he had seen in the steamship ticket
      office two days previous.
    </p>
    <p>
      They were not walking as walk two men abroad at this hour for a
      constitutional. Neither did they walk as walk men churchward bound. A
      slight, skulking air marked their progress, and caused Webster to wonder
      idly what they were stalking.
    </p>
    <p>
      He turned into the path down which the two men had passed, not with the
      slightest idea of shadowing them, but because his destination lay in that
      direction. The Central Americans were approximately fifty yards in advance
      of him as he turned in their wake, and at sight of them his suspicion that
      they were stalking something was quickened into belief.
    </p>
    <p>
      Both men had forsaken the gravelled path and were walking on the soft
      velvet of blue grass lawn that fringed it!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps I'd better deaden my hoof beats also,&rdquo; John
      Stuart Webster soliloquized, and followed suit immediately.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had scarcely done so when the men ahead of him paused abruptly. Webster
      did likewise, and responding&mdash;subconsciously, perhaps, to the
      remembrance of the menace in the glance of the man with the puckered eye&mdash;he
      stepped out of sight behind a broad oak tree. Through the trees and
      shrubbery he could still see the lovers, who had halted and evidently were
      about to part.
    </p>
    <p>
      Webster saw the young man glance warily about; then, apparently satisfied
      there was none to spy upon them, he drew the girl gently toward him. She
      clung to him for nearly a minute, sobbing; then he raised her face
      tenderly, kissed her, pressed her from him, and walked swiftly away
      without looking back.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a sweet and rather touching little tableau; to John Stuart Webster,
      imaginative and possessed of a romantic streak in his nature, it was more
      than a tableau. It was a moving picture!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suppose her old man objects to the young fellow,&rdquo; he
      muttered to himself sympathetically, &ldquo;and he can't come near
      the house. They've met here for the fond farewell, and now the young
      fellow's going out West to make his fortune, so he can come back and
      claim the girl. Huh! If he wants her, why the devil doesn't he take
      her? I'd tell her old man I'd picked on him for my
      father-in-law, and then if he didn't like me I'd let the old
      fellow rave; and see how much good it would do him. But the French are
      different; they always let the old folks step in and rock the boat&mdash;&mdash;-
      Hello! By Judas priest! Now I know what those two paraqueets are up to.
      One of them is the father of that girl. They've been spying on the
      lovers, and now they're going to corner the young fellow and shingle
      him for his nerve.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The girl had stood for a moment, gazing after her companion, before she
      turned with her handkerchief to her eyes, and continued on her way to the
      cathedral. Webster had observed that the two men ahead of him paid no
      attention to her, but pressed eagerly forward after the man.
    </p>
    <p>
      Webster could look across about thirty yards of low shrubbery at the girl
      as she passed. He heard her sobbing as she stumbled blindly by, and he was
      distressed about her, for all the world loves a lover and John Stuart
      Webster was no exception to this universal rule.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By George, this is pretty tough,&rdquo; he reflected. &ldquo;That
      young fellow treated that girl with as much gentleness and courtesy as any
      gentleman should, and I'm for him and against this idea of corporal
      punishment. Don't you worry, Tillie, my dear. I'm going to
      horn into this game myself if it goes too far.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The two dusky skulkers ahead of him, having come to another crosspath,
      turned into it and came out on the main path in the rear of the young man.
      Webster noticed that they were walking twice as fast as when he had first
      observed them, and more than ever convinced that presently there might be
      work for a strong man and true, he hastened after them.
    </p>
    <p>
      As he came out into the main walk again, he noticed that the pair were
      still walking on the grass. He padded gently along behind them.
    </p>
    <p>
      The four were now rapidly approaching the old French market, and the
      steadily rising babel of voices speaking in French, Italian, Spanish,
      Creole patois and Choctaw, was sufficient to have drowned the slight noise
      of the pursuit, even had the young man's mind not been upon other
      things, and the interest of the two Central Americans centred upon their
      quarry, to the exclusion, of any thought of possible interruption.
    </p>
    <p>
      Webster felt instinctively that the two men would rush and make a
      concerted attack from the rear. He smiled.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'll just fool you two <i>hombres</i> a whole lot,&rdquo; he
      thought, and stooping, picked up a small stone. On the instant the two
      men, having approached within thirty feet of their quarry, made a rush for
      him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Their charge was swift, but swift though it was, the little stone which
      John Stuart Webster hurled was swifter. It struck the young man fairly
      between the shoulderblades with a force sufficient to bring him out of his
      sentimental reverie with a jerk, as it were. He whirled, saw the danger
      that threatened him, and&mdash;sprang to meet it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bravo!&rdquo; yelled Webster, and ran to his aid, for he had seen
      now that it was to be knife work. Tragedy instead of melodrama.
    </p>
    <p>
      The man with the puckered eye closed in with such eagerness it was
      apparent to Webster that here was work to his liking. The young man raised
      his light cane, but Pucker-eye did not hesitate. He merely threw up his
      left forearm to meet the expected blow aimed at his head, lunged forward
      and slashed viciously at the young man's abdomen. The latter drew
      back a step, doubled like a jack-knife, and brought his cane down
      viciously across the knuckles of his assailant's right hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So it is thou, son of a pig,&rdquo; he called pleasantly in
      Spanish. &ldquo;I fooled you that time, didn't I?&rdquo; he added in
      English. &ldquo;Thought I would aim for your head, didn't you?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The blow temporarily paralyzed the assassin's hand; he dropped the
      knife, and as he stooped to recover it with his left hand, the young man,
      before retreating from Pop-eye, kicked Pucker-eye in the face and quite
      upset him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Stop it!&rdquo; shouted Webster.
    </p>
    <p>
      Pop-eye turned his head at the outcry. The man he was attacking fell into
      the position of a swordsman en garde, and thrust viciously with the ferule
      at the face of the pop-eyed man, who, disregarding Webster's
      approach, seized the cane in his left hand and with a quick, powerful tug
      actually drew his victim toward him a foot before the latter let go the
      stick.
    </p>
    <p>
      Before he could give ground again Pop-eye was upon him. He grasped the
      young man by the latter's left arm and held him, while he drew back
      for the awful disembowelling stroke; as his long arm sped forward the hook
      of John Stuart Webster's heavy cane descended upon that flexed arm
      in the brook of the elbow, snagging it cleverly.
    </p>
    <p>
      The knife never reached its destination!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You would, would you?&rdquo; said Webster reproachfully, and jerked
      the fellow violently around. The man he had rescued promptly struck
      Pop-eye a terrible blow in the face with his left hand and broke loose
      from the grip that had so nearly been his undoing; whereupon Webster
      tapped the assassin a meditative tap or two on the top of his sinful head
      for good measure and to awaken in him some sense of the impropriety and
      futility of resistance, after which Webster turned to discuss a similar
      question of ethics with Pucker-eye.
    </p>
    <p>
      The scar-cheeked man was on his knees, groping groggily for his knife, for
      he had received a severe kick under the chin, and for the nonce was far
      from dangerous. Stooping, Webster picked up the knife; then with knife and
      cane grasped in his left hand he seized Pucker-eye by the nape with his
      right and jerked him to his feet. The assassin stood glowering at him in a
      perfect frenzy of brutish, inarticulate fury.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Take the knife away from the other fellow before he gets active
      again,&rdquo; Webster called over his shoulder. &ldquo;I'll manage
      this rascal. We'll march them over to the market and turn them over
      to the police.&rdquo; He spoke in Spanish.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thanks, ever so much, for my life,&rdquo; the young man answered
      lightly, and in English, &ldquo;but where I come from it is not the
      fashion to settle these arguments in a court of law. To call an officer is
      considered unclublike; to shoot a prisoner in this country is considered
      murder, and consequently I have but one alternative and I advise you, my
      good friend, to have a little of the same. I'm going to run like the
      devil.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      And he did. He was in full flight before Webster could glance around, and
      in an instant he was lost to sight among the trees.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That advice sounds eminently fair and reasonable,&rdquo; Webster
      yelled after him, and was about to follow when he observed that the young
      man had abandoned his pretty little silver-chased walking stick.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's too nice a little stick to leave to these brigands,&rdquo;
      he thought, and forthwith possessed himself of it and the pop-eyed man's
      knife, after which he tarried not upon the order of his going but went,
      departing at top speed.
    </p>
    <p>
      The young man he had saved from being butchered was right. An entangling
      alliance with the police was, decidedly, not to John Stuart Webster's
      liking, for should, he, unfortunately, form such an alliance, he would be
      haled into court as a witness and perhaps miss the steamer to San
      Buenaventura.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Drat it,&rdquo; he soliloquized, as he emerged from the square and
      observed his taxi parked at the entrance to the market, &ldquo;I came
      through that square so fast I haven't the slightest idea what the
      last half of it looks like. That's what I get for mixing in a little
      Donnybrook that's none of my business.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He had planned to spend an hour in the market, drink a cup of <i>café noir</i>,
      smoke a cigarette, and return to his hotel in time for a leisurely
      breakfast, but his recent bout with grim reality had blunted the edge of
      romance. He ordered his driver to take him back to the hotel, sprang
      inside and congratulated himself on his lucky escape.

      CHAPTER XII
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">W</span>EBSTER'S
      trunk went aboard the steamer early the following morning, and at noon he
      entered a taxi with his hand baggage and was driven to the levee where <i>La
      Estrellita</i> lay tugging gently at her mooring lines. Owing to the
      congestion of freight and traffic the chauffeur stopped his cab a little
      distance from the gangplank, where Webster discharged him with a liberal
      tip.
    </p>
    <p>
      The latter, however, swung his passenger's bag and suitcase to the
      ground, picked them up and started for the gangplank.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Never mind my baggage, lad,&rdquo; Webster called after him.
      &ldquo;One of the deck boys will care for it.&rdquo; The chauffeur turned.
      &ldquo;You've been very generous with me, sir,&rdquo; he answered,
      &ldquo;so I think I had better carry your baggage aboard. If you permit a
      deck boy to handle it, you merely have to give another tip, and that would
      be sheer wanton waste. Why shouldn't I earn the one you gave me?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hadn't figured it out that way, son, so here's
      another half dollar for being the only existing specimen of your species
      in captivity. My stateroom is No. 34, upper deck, port side,&rdquo;
      Webster answered, smiling. The man took the tip eagerly and hurried toward
      the gangplank; the quartermaster on duty shouldered a way for him and he
      darted aboard?
    </p>
    <p>
      Webster followed leisurely. At the gangplank the purser's clerk
      halted him, examined his tickets and punched them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where is the other man?&rdquo; he asked. &ldquo;You have two
      tickets here.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, that blamed valet of mine,&rdquo; Webster answered, and glanced
      around as if in search of that mythical functionary. &ldquo;It would be
      like the stupid fellow to miss the boat,&rdquo; he added. &ldquo;When he
      comes&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Webster ceased speaking abruptly. He was looking straight into the
      malevolent orbs of Pucker-eye, who was standing just behind the clerk at
      the foot of the gangplank.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wonder if Popeye's around, also,&rdquo; Webster thought,
      and he faced about. Pop-eye was standing in back of him, leaning over the
      railing of the gangway.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Which is the valet?&rdquo; the purser's clerk asked, scanning
      the names on the tickets.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Andrew Bowers.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All right, Mr. Webster,&rdquo; the other answered, with that genial
      camaraderie that seems inseparable from all of his calling. &ldquo;When
      Andrew comes I'll send him aboard.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He started to pass the tickets back to Webster, but a detaining hand
      rested on his arm, while a dark thumb and forefinger lifted the trailing
      strips of tickets. Pucker-eye was examining them also.
    </p>
    <p>
      He sent his elbow backward violently into Pucker-eye's midriff and
      shook him off roughly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you mean, you black-and-tan hound?&rdquo; he demanded.
      &ldquo;Since when did you begin to O. K. my work?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Pucker-eye made no reply to this stern reproof. He accepted the elbow with
      equanimity, and faced Webster with an evil smile that indicated mutual
      recognition.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bueno,&rdquo; he said, with such genuine satisfaction that Webster
      could not help demanding:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>Por que es bueno?</i> (Why is it good?)&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We meet the senor first in the teeket office. We meet the senor
      again yesterday morning, no? After, we remember we have meet the senor in
      the teeket office! <i>Quien sabe?</i> The senor he ees sail on <i>La
      Estrellita</i> for San Buenaventura, no?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So you came nosing around to see about it, eh? Doing a little plain
      gumshoe work, I see.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Pucker-eye bowed. By the simple exercise of courage and bad manners he had
      looked at John Stuart Webster's ticket and was now familiar with his
      name and destination.
    </p>
    <p>
      The object of this solicitude had little difficulty in guessing the reason
      behind it all, and he was not happy. He would have preferred that the
      incident of their former meeting should not be held against him; he wished
      most devoutedly that his part in the ruction in Jackson Square on Sunday
      morning might have been forgotten by all concerned, and this revival of
      the unpleasant episode was slightly disconcerting.
    </p>
    <p>
      As a usual thing he was loth to interject himself in the affairs of other
      people, and had a deep-seated animosity against those who did; he would
      have preferred to round out his existence without having to take into
      consideration the presence of a twin Nemesis. However, since the fat was
      in the fire, so to speak, Webster felt that there was nothing for him to
      do save brazen things out as best he could, so he glowered darkly at
      Pucker-eye and said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, you scoundrelly cutthroat, what are you going to do about it?
      Try a little of your knife work on me, I suppose?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Pucker-eye did not answer, but his beady glance wavered and shifted before
      the cool, contemptuous menace of Webster's blue eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Listen, <i>hombre</i>,&rdquo; Webster continued. &ldquo;I know your
      kind of people like a nigger knows cologne. I know what you'd like
      to do to me in exchange for what I did to you yesterday morning, but you
      take a tip from me and don't try it, or one of these days they'll
      be walking slow behind you and your <i>companero</i>, and you won't
      know it!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The fellow grinned&mdash;the kind of grin that is composed of equal parts
      of ferocity and knowledge of superior strength. That grin did more to
      disconcert Webster than the knowledge that he had earned for himself two
      bloodthirsty and implacable enemies, for Pucker-eye was the first of his
      breed that Webster had ever seen smile under insult. That cool smile
      infuriated him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Pucker-eye took out a cigarette case, selected a cigarette, and presented
      the case to Webster. His bad manners in selecting his own cigarette first
      was deliberate, as Webster knew. It was the Latin-American's method
      of showing his contempt.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We shall meet again, Meester Webstaire,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;May
      I offer the senor a cigarette for the&mdash;what you Americans call&mdash;the
      keepsake? No?&rdquo; He smiled brightly and closed his puckered eye in a
      knowing wink.
    </p>
    <p>
      Webster took his tickets from the purser, folded them, placed them in his
      pocket and for a few seconds regarded Pucker-eye contemptuously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When we meet again, you scum,&rdquo; he retorted quietly, &ldquo;you
      shall have no difficulty in remembering me. You may keep your cigarette.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      His long, powerful right arm shot out; like a forceps his thumb and
      forefinger closed over Pucker-eve's rather flat nose; he squeezed,
      and with a shrill scream of agony Pucker-eye went to his knees.
    </p>
    <p>
      Still holding the wretch by his proboscis, Webster turned quickly in order
      that his face might be toward Pop-eye.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pop-eye,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;if you take a hand in this, I'll
      twist your nose, too, and afterward I'll throw you in the river.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He turned to Pucker-eye.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Up, thou curious little one,&rdquo; he said in Spanish, and jerked
      the unhappy rascal to his feet. The latter clawed ineffectually at the
      terrible arm which held him, until, presently discovering that the harder
      he struggled the harder Webster pinched his nose, he ceased his struggles
      and hung limply, moaning with pain and rage in the grip of the American.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good!&rdquo; Webster announced, slacking his grip a little. With
      his left hand he deftly extracted a hair from each flank of the screaming
      little scoundrel's scant moustache, and held them before the latter's
      tear-filled eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My friend,&rdquo; he said gently, &ldquo;mark how the gringo gives
      his little dark brother a lesson in deportment. Behold, if I have given
      thee a souvenir of our meeting, I also have taken one. By this pinched and
      throbbing nose shall I be remembered when I am gone; by these hairs from
      thy rat's moustache shall I remember thee. Go, and thrust not that
      nose into a gringo's business again. It is unsafe.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He released Pucker-eye, nodded brightly to the purser's clerk and
      quartermaster, who, spellbound and approving, had watched him mete out
      retribution according to his code, and went aboard, just as an assistant
      steward came hurrying along the deck beating a lusty solo on a triangle&mdash;the
      signal for all non-passengers to go ashore.
    </p>
    <p>
      Webster made his way through the crowd to his room, looked in, saw that
      his baggage was there, and walked around on the starboard side to join in
      the general farewell of all on board to the crowd on the levee.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the shore end of the gangplank Pucker-eye and Pop-eye still waited. The
      unfortunate Pucker-eye was weeping with pain and futile rage and
      humiliation, but Webster noticed that Pop-eye's attention was not on
      his friend but upon each passenger that boarded the ship, of which there
      were the usual number of late arrivals. As each passenger approached,
      Pop-eye scanned him with more than casual interest.
    </p>
    <p>
      Webster smiled. &ldquo;Looking for that valet they heard me talking about,&rdquo;
      he reflected. &ldquo;Pop-eye, you're a fine, capable lad. I thought
      you had the brains of the two. You're not going away until you've
      had a chance to size up the reinforcements at my command, are you?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Promptly at one o'clock the captain mounted the bridge and ordered
      the gangplank drawn ashore. The breastline was cast off; with a long-drawn
      bellow from her siren the wheel of <i>La Estrellita</i> commenced to churn
      the muddy water and her bow swung gently outboard, while the stern line
      acted as a spring. With the stern line slackened and cast overboard the
      vessel pushed slowly out into the stream where the current caught her and
      swung her in a wide arc. Webster watched Pucker-eye and Pop-eye leave the
      landing arm in arm. Pop-eye was sporty enough to wave at him, and Webster,
      not to be outdone in kind, waved back.
    </p>
    <p>
      He lighted a cigar and leaned over the rail as the steamer, gathering
      speed, swept down river.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good-bye, you golden fizz and chicken gumbo,&rdquo; he called, as
      the city receded and the low, wooded shores below the city came into view.
      He had forgotten Pucker-eye and Pop-eye in the flood of poignant regret
      that swept over him at the memory of the peerless Antoine!

      finished his cigar he cast the stump overboard, watched it until it
      disappeared astern, and then went around to state-room No. 34. As he
      stepped in, and closed the door a masculine voice said very pleasantly:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How do you do?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Webster looked up and beheld a young man, arrayed in a very fancy pair
      of light blue silk pyjamas, stretched at his ease in the upper berth. In
      his right hand he held an open book; his left hand grasped his bare right
      foot, which he was rubbing comfortably; in his mouth he held an aromatic
      Turkish cigarette. He was very much at home, no doubt of that, for he was
      smiling in the friendliest fashion imaginable.
    </p>
    <p>
      John Stuart Webster stared at the stranger for several seconds and
      concluded he was invading the sanctity of another's stateroom.
      &ldquo;Excuse me,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I guess I'm in the right
      church but the wrong pew,&rdquo; and he stepped out and looked for the
      number on the stateroom. To his surprise it <i>was</i> No. 34 after all,
      so he stepped back into the stateroom and favoured the stranger with
      another scrutiny.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It does appear to me, my friend,&rdquo; he said presently, &ldquo;that
      I detect something strangely familiar about your pyjamas.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wouldn't be the least bit surprised, Mr. Webster. I found
      them in your suitcase.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, how do you do?&rdquo; Webster declared. &ldquo;Pretty well,
      all things considered. May I offer you one of your own cigarettes? I found
      them in the suitcase also, and can recommend them highly.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank you very much.&rdquo; Webster helped himself to a cigarette
      and sat down on the settee. Fell a silence of perhaps half a minute. Then:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I dislike to appear inquisitive,&rdquo; Webster began, &ldquo;but
      the fact is, neighbour, I'm curious to know where you got that book.
      I observe you are reading Samuel Butler's 'Way of all Flesh,'
      and that the book is slightly damaged. Recently I purchased such a book in&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pray do not take the trouble to explain,&rdquo; the other answered
      airily. &ldquo;I discovered this excellent book in your suitcase also. In
      fact, for me, that suitcase has proved to be a repository of treasures.&rdquo;
      John Stuart Webster's neck came out of his collar with the
      suddenness of a turtle snapping at a fly; he drew himself up beside the
      top berth until his face was on a level with his unbidden guest's,
      upon whom he bent a look of mingled emotions. On his part the stranger
      returned his gaze with grave interest, and when the silence threatened to
      become embarrassing he said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Will you have the goodness to press that button? I think we should
      drink a bumper to our better acquaintance and I have no doubt but that the
      barkeeper on this packet can manufacture a golden fizz. Do you care for
      the famous New Orleans golden fizz?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is a wonderful institution,&rdquo; Webster replied, &ldquo;and I'll
      have one. I need it to sustain me, for I am faint with amazement.&rdquo;
      He pressed the button. &ldquo;'While the golden fizz is fizzing,&rdquo;
      he continued, &ldquo;suppose you let me have a look at your ticket.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ticket?&rdquo; echoed his visitor. &ldquo;I haven't any
      ticket. A kind gentleman bought one for me and has it in his possession.
      Do you, sir, by any chance, happen to be that philanthropic individual?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I'll be&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hush!&rdquo; the stranger warned, raising an admonitory finger.
      &ldquo;No profanity, please. I have been tenderly reared and cuss words
      will only shock me and clog the atmosphere. I'm here to do you and
      do you a delicate brown, so bear up, kind sir, and take your walloping
      like a sport.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who the devil are you?&rdquo; John Stuart Webster demanded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I regret I have no card, but even if I had it would be no kindness
      to inflict upon an American gentleman the cognomen my parents honoured me
      with, for it is long and many-jointed, like a peanut, and embodies the
      names of all the saints in the calendar. Moreover, just at present I am
      travelling under an alias. I am known as Mr. Andrew Bowers.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And your occupation?&rdquo; Webster managed to articulate.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Valet de chambre to that prince of gentlemen, Mr. John S. Webster,&rdquo;
      the other replied with a mischievous gleam in his dark eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Webster sat down limply on the settee. He was undecided whether to
      roar with laughter or shriek with rage; while he struggled for a decision
      Andrew Bowers blew smoke rings at the ceiling.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Haven't I seen you before?&rdquo; Webster queried presently.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wouldn't be surprised. I drove you down to the steamer in a
      taxi half an hour ago. You will recall that the taxi driver carried your
      luggage aboard.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Webster gazed around the stateroom. &ldquo;Where have you hidden your
      livery?&rdquo; he demanded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wrapped it in a newspaper; then, seeking a moment when the deck
      outside was deserted, I stepped forth in my&mdash;I beg your pardon, your&mdash;pyjamas
      and tossed it overboard.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But apparently you did not bring aboard with you a suit of clothes
      to take the place of your livery?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Quite true&mdash;lamentably so, Mr. Webster. Perhaps you will
      accept my desperate need as an excuse for borrowing your pyjamas. I notice
      you have another suit of them. Fortunate man!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      When confronted by something mysterious it was not John Stuart's
      habit to ask innumerable questions, and for the space of two minutes he
      gave himself up to deduction and a close scrutiny of his companion.
    </p>
    <p>
      Andrew Bowers was a man of perhaps thirty years, five feet ten inches
      tall, and apparently in excellent health. He might have weighed a hundred
      and seventy pounds and he was undeniably handsome. His head was nobly
      formed and covered with thick, wavy hair, shiny and black as ebony; his
      eyes were dark blue; the eyebrows, thick but fine and silky, almost met
      over the bridge of a thin, high nose that was just a trifle too long for
      his face. Webster decided it was the nose of a thinker. Andrew Bowers's
      forehead was broad and high and his head was thick forward of the ears,
      infallible sign of brains; his mouth and chin were full of determination,
      although capable of a smile of singular sweetness; while the skin on his
      legs was milk-white, his hands and face were tanned to the colour of a
      manzanita stick, seeming to indicate that he had lived an outdoor life.
    </p>
    <p>
      While Webster was wondering whether his companion was merely a high-class
      tramp or an absconding bank cashier, a knock sounded on the stateroom
      door. He opened it and the purser stood in the entrance.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tickets, please?&rdquo; he announced.
    </p>
    <p>
      Webster surrendered both tickets, receiving in turn two seat checks for
      the dining saloon, and the purser passed on to the next cabin.
    </p>
    <p>
      Andrew Bowers smiled a small, prescient smile, but said nothing and
      presently John Stuart Webster broke the silence. &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; he
      ordered &ldquo;sing the song or tell the story.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I noticed you surrendered my ticket to the purser,&rdquo; the young
      man answered irrelevantly, &ldquo;and I am glad of that. I take it as <i>prima
      facie</i> evidence that you have made up your mind to accept my company.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You're too infernally cool and cocksure, my friend,&rdquo;
      Webster warned him testily. &ldquo;I pride myself on a sense of humour and
      I dearly love a joke until it's carried too far, but be advised in
      time, young man, and don't try to play horse with me. I haven't
      made up my mind to accept your company, although, provided you do not rub
      my fur the wrong way, I may decide to put up with you, for whether you are
      a decayed gentleman or an engaging scoundrel, you are, at least,
      intelligent and impressive, clean, white, resourceful, and pleasant.
      However, my acceptance or non-acceptance of you is a subject for future
      discussion, since at present we have some fiduciary matters before us. You
      owe me fifty dollars for your ticket, Andrew Bowers, and in view of the
      fact that I never saw you before to-day, suppose we start the voyage by
      squaring the account.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Andrew Bowers sat up in the berth and let his legs drape over the side.
      &ldquo;Mr. Webster,&rdquo; he began seriously, &ldquo;had I sung my song
      or told my story before you surrendered that ticket to the purser I might
      have found myself in a most embarrassing predicament. If, prior to the
      arrival of the purser to collect the tickets, you had handed my ticket to
      me, saying: 'Here is your ticket, Mr. Bowers. Be kind enough to
      reimburse me to the extent of fifty dollars,' I should have been
      compelled to admit then, as I do now, that I haven't fifty dollars.
      Fortunately for me, however, you surrendered the ticket to the purser
      before acquainting yourself with the state of my fortunes; the voyage has
      commenced and whether you like it or not, my dear sir, I am your guest
      from now until we reach San Buenaventura. Rather an interesting situation,
      don't you think?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      John Stuart Webster was of Scotch ancestry. He had an hereditary regard
      for his baubees. He was a business man. Prodigal spender though he was and
      generous to a fault, the fact remained that he always made it a point to
      get value received, and he was prodigal with his own money; he preferred
      that the privilege of prodigality with the Websterian funds should remain
      an inalienable prerogative of the sole surviving member of the Webster
      family. He gazed contemplatively now upon his devil-may-care, unbidden
      guest, torn between a desire to whisk him out of the berth and shake him
      until his teeth fell out, and another to be just and patient, in the hope
      that some great extenuating circumstance might be adduced to account for
      this impudent daylight robbery. Mr. Webster had been deluded, cheated,
      robbed, and pillaged many a time and oft in the course of his rather
      eventful career, but he had yet to meet the man who, having swindled him
      out of fifty dollars, had the effrontery to add insult to injury by
      exhibiting a perfectly obvious intention of making him like it. Indeed,
      John Stuart Webster was obsessed with a secret fear that the smiling
      bandit in the upper berth was going to succeed in his nefarious design,
      and, in the contemplation of this unheard-of <i>contretemps</i>, the
      genial John was struck temporarily speechless.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The last cent I had in the world went to that taxi person whose
      taxi I borrowed and whose old uniform I purchased,&rdquo; Andrew Bowers
      supplemented his confession.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You asked me to ring for two golden fizzes,&rdquo; Webster
      reproached him. &ldquo;Am I to be stuck for the drinks? Not satisfied with
      rooking me for a first-class passage to San Buenaventura you plan to tack
      on extras, eh?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I'll pay for the drinks,&rdquo; Andrew Bowers assured
      him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How can you, if you gave your last cent to that taxi driver?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You tipped me very liberally for carrying your baggage aboard,&rdquo;
      Andrew Bowers retorted slyly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ouch!&rdquo; cried Mr. Webster, and laughed. The very next instant
      he was provoked at himself for having done so. That laugh gave the brigand
      Andrew a decided advantage, for it placed Webster on defensive ground. He
      was convinced of this when the brigand said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thanks for that laugh, Mr. Webster. It arouses hope in my sad
      heart. I have outraged your patience, your privacy, and your pocketbook&mdash;yet
      you laughed. <i>Bueno</i>. I will be equally good-natured and forgive you
      for questioning my sincerity in the matter of dispensing my hospitality;
      even the little slur cast on my veracity in the matter of my finances
      shall pass unnoticed.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think you're too cool, young man,&rdquo; Webster retorted.
      &ldquo;Just a trifle too cocksure. Up to the present moment you have
      proffered no evidence why you should not be adjudged a cad, and I do not
      like cads and must decline to permit one to occupy the same stateroom at
      my expense. You are clever and amusing and I laughed at you, but at the
      same time my sense of humour is not so great as to cause me to overlook
      your impudence and laugh with you. Now, if you have anything to say, say
      it quickly, because you're going to go away from here&mdash;in a
      hurry.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I plead guilty to the indictment, Mr. Webster, and submit as an
      excuse the fact that desperate circumstances require desperate measures. I
      am not begging my way, neither am I beating it, for the reason that both
      forms of travel are repugnant to me. I am merely taking advantage of
      certain fortuitous circumstances to force you, an entire stranger, to
      extend to me a credit of fifty dollars until we reach San Buenaventura
      when you will be promptly reimbursed. I had thought,&rdquo; he added
      sadly, &ldquo;that my face might prove ample security for a fifty-dollar
      loan. There has never been a crook in my family and I have never been
      charged with a penal offence or been in jail.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is not my habit,&rdquo; Webster retorted stiffly, &ldquo;to
      extend credit to strangers who demand it.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do not demand it, sir. I beg it of you, and because I cannot
      afford to be refused I took care to arrange matters so that you would not
      be likely to refuse my request. Really, I do not mean to be cocksure and
      impudent, but before you throw me out I'd like to let you in on a
      secret about yourself.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You're not going to throw me out.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why not?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because you can't.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's fighting talk. Now, just to prove to you the depth of
      error in which you flounder, young man, I am about to throw you out.&rdquo;
      And he grasped Andrew Bowers in the grip of a grizzly bear and whisked him
      out of the top berth.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wait one second,&rdquo; his helpless victim cried. &ldquo;I have
      something to say before you go any further.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Say it,&rdquo; Webster ordered. &ldquo;Your tongue is the only part
      of you that I cannot control.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When you throw me out on deck,&rdquo; Andrew Bowers queried,
      &ldquo;do your pyjamas go with me? Does the hair go with the hide?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They cost me sixteen dollars in Salt Lake City, but&mdash;good
      lord, yes. I can't throw you out mother naked; damn it, I can't
      throw you out at all.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Didn't I tell you so? Be a good fellow and turn me loose.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainly&mdash;for the time being. You'll stay locked in
      this stateroom while I have a talk with the captain. He'll probably
      dig up a shirt, a pair of dungarees, and some old shoes for you and set
      you ashore before we get out of the river. If he doesn't do that he'll
      keep you aboard and you'll shovel coal for your passage.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I'm Andrew Bowers and the purser has collected my
      first-class ticket!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What of it? I shall declare&mdash;and with truth&mdash;that you are
      not Andrew Bowers, that you are not my valet, and that I did not buy the
      ticket for you. I dare you to face the captain in my pyjamas and prove you
      aren't a stowaway.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You would win on that point,&rdquo; the baffling guest admitted,
      &ldquo;but it is a point you will not raise. Why? Because I have another
      trump up my kimono.&rdquo; He climbed back into the upper berth and from
      that vantage point gazed down benevolently upon John Stuart Webster.
      &ldquo;I'm disappointed in you,&rdquo; he continued sadly. &ldquo;I
      thought you'd show a little normal human curiosity about me&mdash;and
      you haven't. You do not ask questions or I could explain, while I
      cannot volunteer information without seeming to seek your pity, and that
      course would be repugnant to me. I have never shovelled coal, although I
      daresay I could manage to earn my passage as a stoker; indeed, I daresay I
      shall have to, if you insist on being belligerent, and if you insist I
      shall not oppose you. I am hoping, however, that you will not insist, but
      that you will, on the contrary, accept my word of honour that you shall be
      reimbursed two hours after you land in San Buenaventura.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;New music to your song, my friend, but the same old words,&rdquo;
      Webster retorted, and stepped to the stateroom door. &ldquo;You're
      doomed to shovel coal or go ashore.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Listen. If I go ashore, your responsibility for my life ceases, Mr.
      Webster, but if the chief engineer happens to be short one coal-passer and
      the captain sends me down to the stokehole, your responsibility for my
      death begins, for I'll be put ashore publicly at San Buenaventura
      and two hours later I'll be facing a firing squad in the cemetery of
      the Catedrâl de la Vera Cruz.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Gosh,&rdquo; John Stuart Webster murmured dazedly, &ldquo;I'm
      afraid I can't take a chance like that for fifty dollars.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      A knock sounded on the door and Webster opened it. A waiter stood in the
      entrance. &ldquo;Did you ring, sir?&rdquo; he queried.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I did,&rdquo; replied John Stuart Webster. &ldquo;Bring up two
      glasses and a quart of the best wine aboard the ship.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The waiter hastened away and Webster turned to face the little, cryptic,
      humorous smile that made his travelling companion so singularly boyish and
      attractive.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You win, son,&rdquo; Webster declared. &ldquo;I'm whipped to
      a frazzle. Any time I'm sitting in back of a royal flush and the
      other fellow bluffs me out of the pot, I always buy the wine. When it
      arrives we shall drink to our better acquaintance. Pending its arrival,
      please be advised that you are welcome to my pyjamas, my cigarettes, my
      book, and my stateroom. You are my guest and you owe me nothing, except,
      perhaps, your confidence, although I do not insist upon that point. Where
      I come from every man kills his own snakes.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      And he held up his hand for Andrew Bowers to shake.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Webster,&rdquo; the latter declared feelingly, &ldquo;I am not
      a lord of language, so I cannot find words to thank you. I agree with you
      that you are entitled to my confidence. My name is&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tut, tut, my boy. Your name is Andrew Bowers, and that identifies
      you sufficiently for the time being. Your face is a guaranty of your
      character and entitles you to a nominal credit.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Make me no buts. I care not who you are; perhaps what I do not know
      will not distress me. When I suggested that I was entitled to a measure of
      your confidence, I meant on a few minor points only&mdash;points on which
      my curiosity has been abnormally aroused.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very well, my friend. Fire away.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you an American citizen?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, I am a citizen of Sobrante.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have assured me that you are not a crook; consequently I know
      you are not fleeing from the United States authorities. You had no money
      to pay for your passage to San Buenaventura so you schemed to make me pay
      your way. Hence I take it that your presence in the capital of your native
      country is a matter of extreme importance and that the clerk in the ticket
      office of the Caribbean Mail Line is a friend of yours.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Quite true. He knew my need.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You were under surveillance and could not leave New Orleans for San
      Buenaventura unless you left secretly. When I purchased both berths in
      this stateroom and the ticket clerk knew I held a firstclass ticket for a
      valet that was not, he decided to saw off on me a valet that was. So he
      gave you my name and the name of my hotel, you arranged matters with the
      taxi starter and the taxi driver and drove me to the steamer. Disguised in
      the livery of a chauffeur and carrying hand baggage you hoped to get
      aboard without being detected by your enemies who watched the gangplank.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Andrew Bowers nodded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you think you succeeded?&rdquo; Webster continued.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do not know, Mr. Webster. I hope so. If I did not&mdash;well, the
      instant this steamer drops anchor in the roadstead at San Buenaventura,
      she will be boarded and searched by the military police, I will be
      discovered and&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; He shrugged.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Lawn party in the cemetery, eh?&rdquo; Webster suggested.
    </p>
    <p>
      Andrew Bowers reached under his pillow and produced two heavy automatic
      pistols and a leathern box containing five clips of cartridges. These he
      exhibited in silence and then thrust them back under the pillow.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I see, Andrew. In case you're cornered, eh? Well, I think I
      would prefer to die fighting myself. However, let us hope you will not
      have to face any such unpleasant alternative.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm not worried, Mr. Webster. Somehow, I think I ran the
      gauntlet safely.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But why did you throw your livery overboard?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was of no further use to me. A chauffeur on shipboard would be
      most incongruous, and the sight of the livery hanging on yonder peg would
      be certain to arouse the curiosity of the room steward. And I'm not
      going to appear on deck throughout the voyage, might meet somebody who
      knows me.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you'll have to have some clothes in which to go ashore,
      you amazing man.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not at all. The steamer will arrive in the harbour of San
      Buenaventura late in the afternoon&mdash;too late to be given pratique
      that day. After dark I shall drop overboard and endeavour to swim ashore,
      and in view of that plan clothes would only prove an embarrassment. I
      shall land in my own country naked and penniless, but once ashore I shall
      quickly find shelter. I'll have to risk the sharks, of course.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Man-eaters?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The bay is swarming with them.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You're breaking my heart,&rdquo; Webster declared
      sympathetically. &ldquo;I suppose you're going to feign illness
      throughout the voyage.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not the land of illness that will interfere with my appetite. I
      have prescribed for myself a mild attack of inflammatory rheumatism, as an
      excuse for remaining in bed and having my meals brought to me. This
      service, of course, will necessitate some slight expense in the way of
      tips, but I am hoping you will see your way clear to taking care of that
      for your guest.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Silently Webster handed Andrew Bowers ten dollars in silver. &ldquo;That
      ought to hold you,&rdquo; he declared. &ldquo;For the rest, you're
      up to some political skullduggery in Sobrante, and what it is and what's
      your real name are two subjects in which I am not interested. I am on a
      vacation and intend to amuse myself. If I find you as amusing as you
      appear at the outset of our acquaintance I shall do my best to break the
      tedium of your confinement in this stateroom and if I find you dull I
      shall leave you to your own devices. Let us talk anything but business and
      personalities and let it be understood that you are my valet, Andrew
      Bowers. That's all I know about you and that's all I care to
      know about you. In fact, the less I know about you the less will I have to
      explain in the event of your sudden demise.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Fair enough,&rdquo; quoth Andrew Bowers. &ldquo;You're a man
      after my own heart. I thank you.&rdquo;
    </p>

      CHAPTER XIV
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">P</span>RIOR to leaving
      New Orleans, Webster had cabled Billy Geary that he was taking passage on
      <i>La Estrellita</i> and stating the approximate date of his arrival at
      San Buenaventura&mdash;which information descended upon that young man
      with something of the charm of a gentle rainfall over a hitherto arid
      district. He had been seeing Dolores Ruey at least once a day ever since
      her return to Sobrante; indeed, only the fear that he might wear out his
      welcome prevented him from seeing her twice a day. He was quick,
      therefore, to seize upon Webster's cablegram as an excuse to call
      upon Dolores and explain the mystery surrounding his friend's
      nonappearance.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, Dolores,&rdquo; he began, in his excitement calling her by
      her first name for the first time, &ldquo;they say it's a long lane
      that hasn't got a saloon at the end of it. I've heard from
      Jack Webster.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What's the news, Bill?&rdquo; Dolores inquired. From the
      first day of their acquaintance she had been growing increasingly fond of
      Geary; for nearly a week she had been desirous of calling him Bill, which
      is a comfortable name and, to Dolores's way of thinking, a
      peculiarly appropriate cognomen for such a distinctly American young man.
      At mention of the beloved word he glanced down at her pleasurably.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank you,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I'm glad you got around to
      it finally. Those that love me always call me Bill.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You called me Dolores.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I move we make it unanimous. I'm a foe to formality.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Second the motion, Bill. So am I&mdash;when I care to be&mdash;and
      in our case your formality is spoiling our comradeship. And now, with
      reference to the extraordinary Senor Webster&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, the poor old horse has been down with ptomaine poisoning. They
      carried him off the train at St. Louis and stood him on his head and
      pumped him out and just did manage to cancel his order for a new
      tombstone. He says he's feeding regularly again and has booked
      passage on <i>La Estrellita</i>, so we can look for him on the next
      steamer arriving.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, the poor fellow!&rdquo; Dolores murmured&mdash;so fervently
      that Billy was on the point of hurling his heart at her feet on the
      instant.
    </p>
    <p>
      The thousand dollars Webster had cabled Billy &ldquo;for a road-stake&rdquo;
      had been dwindling rapidly under the stimulus of one continous opportunity
      to spend the same in a quarter where it was calculated to bring the most
      joy. The pleasures of the Sobrantean capital were not such that the
      average Yankee citizen might be inspired to prefer them with any degree of
      enthusiasm, but such as they were, Dolores Ruey had them all. In a country
      where the line between pure blood and mixed is drawn so strictly as it is
      in Sobrante, Billy Geary was, of course, a social impossibility. He was a
      Caucasian who would shake hands and have a drink with a gentleman whose
      nails showed blue at the bases, for all his white skin&mdash;and in the
      limited upper-class circles of Buenaventura, where none but pure-bred
      descendants of purebred Castilians intermingled, the man or woman who
      failed, however slightly, to remember at all times that he was white, was
      distinctly <i>persona non grata</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      The first time Billy appeared in public riding in the same victoria with
      Mother Jenks and Dolores, therefore, he was fully aware that for the
      future Dolores Ruey was like himself, socially defunct in Sobrante.
      However, he did not care, for he had a sneaking suspicion Dolores was as
      indifferent as he; in fact, he took a savage delight in the knowledge that
      the girl would be proscribed, for with Dolores cut off from all other
      society she must, of necessity, turn to him throughout her visit. So, up
      to the night <i>La Estrellita</i>, with John Stuart Webster on board,
      dropped anchor on the quarantine-ground, Mr. Geary was the unflagging
      ballyhoo for a personally conducted tour of Dolores Ruey's native
      land within a radius of fifteen miles about Buenaventura. He was
      absolutely bogged in the quagmire of his first love affair, but until his
      mining concession should amply justify an avowal of his passion, an
      instinctive sense of the eternal fitness of things reminded Billy of the
      old proverb that a closed mouth catches no flies. And in the meantime
      (such is the optimism of youth) he decided there was no need for worry,
      for when a girl calls a fellow Bill, when she tells him he's a scout
      and doesn't care a whoop for any society except his&mdash;<i>caramba!</i>
      it's great!
    </p>
    <p>
      A wireless from Webster warned Billy of the former's imminent
      arrival. Just before sunset Billy and Dolores, riding along the Malecon,
      sighted a blur of smoke far out to sea&mdash;a blur that grew and grew
      until they could make out the graceful white hull of <i>La Estrellita</i>,
      before the swift tropic night descended and the lights of the great vessel
      shimmered across the harbour.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Too late to clear quarantine to-night,&rdquo; Billy mourned, as he
      and Dolores rode back to her hotel. &ldquo;All the same, I'm going
      to borrow the launch of my good friend Leber and his <i>protégé</i> Don
      Juan Cafetéro, and go out to the steamer to-night. I can heave to a little
      way from the steamer and welcome the old rascal, anyhow; he'll be
      expecting me to do that, and I wouldn't disappoint him for a farm.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Fortunately, good little Leber consented to Billy's request, and Don
      Juan Cafetéro was sober enough to turn the engine over and run the launch.
      From the deck of the steamer Webster, smoking his postprandial cigar,
      caught sight of the launch's red and green sidelights chugging
      through the inky blackness; as the little craft slid up to within a cable's-length
      of the steamer and hove to, something told Webster that Billy Geary would
      soon be paging him. He edged over to the rail.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That you, Bill?&rdquo; he shouted.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hey! Jack, old pal!&rdquo; Billy's delighted voice answered
      him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I knew you'd come, Billy boy.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I knew you'd know it, Johnny. Can't come aboard, you
      know, until the ship clears, but I can lie off here and say hello. How is
      your internal mechanism?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Grand. I've got the world by the tail on a down-hill haul
      once more, son. However, your query reminds me I haven't taken the
      medicine the doctor warned me to take after meals for a couple of weeks.
      Wait a minute, Bill, until I go to my stateroom and do my duty by my
      stomach.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      For ten minutes Billy and Don Juan Cafetéro bobbed about in the launch;
      then a stentorian voice shouted from the steamer. &ldquo;Hey, you! In the
      launch, there. Not so close. Back off.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Don Juan kicked the launch back fifty feet. &ldquo;That will do!&rdquo;
      the voice called again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hello!&rdquo; Billy soliloquized. &ldquo;That's Jack Webster's
      voice. I've heard him bossing a gang of miners too often not to
      recognize that note of command. Wonder what he's up to. I thought he
      acted strangely&mdash;preferring medicine to me the minute I hailed him!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      While he was considering the matter, a voice behind him said very softly
      and indistinctly, like a man with a harelip:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Geary, will you be good enough to back your launch a couple of
      hundred feet? When I'm certain I can't be seen from the
      steamer, I'll come aboard.&rdquo; Billy turned, and in the dim light
      of his binnacle lamp observed a beautiful pair of white hands grasping the
      gunwale on the starboard quarter. He peered over and made out the head and
      shoulders of a man.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All right,&rdquo; he replied in a low voice. &ldquo;Hang where you
      are, and you'll be clear of the propeller.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He signalled Don Juan, who backed swiftly away, while Billy doused the
      binnacle lamp.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That'll do,&rdquo; the thick voice said presently. &ldquo;Bear
      a hand, friend, and I'll climb over.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He came, as naked as Mercury, sprawled on his belly in the cockpit, opened
      his mouth, spat out a compact little roll of tinfoil, opened it and drew
      out a ball of paper which he flattened out on the floor of the cockpit and
      handed up to Billy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank you,&rdquo; he said, very courteously and distinctly now.
      &ldquo;My credentials, Mr. Geary, if you please.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Billy re-lighted the lamp and read:
    </p>
    <p>
      Dear Billy:
    </p>
    <p>
      I do not know the bearer from Adam's off ox; all I know about him is
      that he has all the outward marks of a gentleman, the courage of a
      bear-cat, a sense of humor and a head for which the Présidente of Sobrante
      will gladly pay a considerable number of <i>pesos oro</i>. Don't
      give up the head, because I like it and we do not need the money&mdash;yet.
      Take him ashore without anybody knowing it; hide him, clothe him, feed him&mdash;then
      forget all about him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ever thine,
    </p>
    <p>
      J. S. Webster.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Kick the boat ahead again, Cafferty,&rdquo; Billy ordered quietly.
      He turned to the late arrival.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Man, your credentials are all in apple-pie order. Do you happen
      to know this bay is swarming with man-eating sharks?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The man raised a fine, strong, youthful face and grinned at him. &ldquo;Hobson's
      choice, Mr. Geary,&rdquo; he replied. &ldquo;Afloat or ashore, the sharks
      are after me. Sir, I am your debtor.&rdquo; He crawled into the cabin and
      stretched out on the settee as John Stuart Webster's voice came
      floating across the dark waters. &ldquo;Hey, Billy!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hey, yourself!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Everything well with you, Billy?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All is lovely, Jack, and the goose honks high. By the way, that
      friend of yours called with his letter of introduction. I took care of
      him.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thanks. I suppose you'll call for me in that launch to-morrow
      morning?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Surest thing you know, Jack. Good-night, old top.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good-night, Billy. See you in the morning.&rdquo; Don Juan Cafetéra
      swung the launch and headed back for the city. At Leber's little
      dock Billy stepped ashore, while Don Juan backed out into the dark bay
      again in order to avoid inquisitive visitors. Billy hastened to El Buen
      Amigo and returned presently with a bundle of clothes; at an agreed signal
      Don Juan kicked the launch into the dock again and Billy went aboard.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hat, shirt, necktie, duck suit, white socks, and shoes,&rdquo; he
      whispered. &ldquo;Climb into them, stranger.&rdquo; Once more the launch
      backed out in the bay, where Webster's <i>protégé</i> dressed at his
      leisure, and Billy handed Don Juan a couple of pesos.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Remember, John,&rdquo; he cautioned the bibulous one as they tied
      up for the night, &ldquo;nothing unusual happened to-night.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Divil a thing, Misther Geary. Thank you, sor,&rdquo; the Gaelic
      wreck replied blithely and disappeared in the darkness, leaving Billy to
      guide the stranger to El Buen Amigo, where he was taken into the
      confidence of Mother Jenks and, on Billy's guarantee of the board
      bill, furnished with a room and left to his own devices.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /><br />
    </p>
    <hr />
    <p>
      <br /><br />
    </p>
    <p>
      John Stuart Webster came down the gangplank into Leber's launch hard
      on the heels of the port doctor.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You young horse-thief,&rdquo; he cried affectionately. &ldquo;I
      believe it's the custom down this way for men to kiss each other. We'll
      dispense with that, but by&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; He folded Billy in a
      paternal embrace, then held him at arm's length and looked him over.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Lord, son,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;you're as thin as a snake.
      I'll have to feed you up.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      As they sped toward the landing, he looked Billy over once more. &ldquo;I
      have it,&rdquo; he declared. &ldquo;You need a change of climate to get
      rid of that malaria. Just show me this little old mining claim of yours,
      Bill, and then hike for God's country. Three months up there will
      put you right again, and by the time you get back, we'll be about
      ready to weigh the first cleanup.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Billy shook his head. &ldquo;I'd like to mighty well, Jack,&rdquo;
      he replied, &ldquo;but I just can't.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Huh! I suppose you don't think I'm equal to the task of
      straightening out this concession of yours and making a hummer out of it,
      eh?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The young fellow looked across at him sheepishly. &ldquo;Mine?&rdquo; he
      jeered. &ldquo;Who's talking about a mine. I'm thinking of a
      girl!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Some girl, Johnny.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hope she's not some parrakeet,&rdquo; Webster bantered.
      &ldquo;Have you looked up her pedigree?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah-h-h!&rdquo; Billy spat over the side in sheer disgust. &ldquo;This
      is an American girl&mdash;born here, but white&mdash;raised in the U. S.
      A. I've only known her three weeks, but&mdash;ah!&rdquo; And Billy
      kissed his hand into space.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I'm glad I find you so happy, boy. I suppose you're
      going to let your old Jack-partner give her the once-over and render his
      report before you make the fatal leap&mdash;eh?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sure! I want you to meet her. I've been telling her all about
      you, and she's crazy to meet you.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good news! I had a good friend once&mdash;twice&mdash;three times&mdash;and
      lost him every time. Wives get so suspicious of their husband's
      single friends, you know, so Ï hope I make a hit with your heart's
      desire, Billy. When do you pull off the wedding?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; said Billy, &ldquo;that's premature, Jack. I haven't
      asked her. How could I until I'm able to support her?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Look here, son,&rdquo; Webster replied, &ldquo;don't you go
      to work and be the kind of fool I was. You get married and take a chance.
      If you do, you'll have a son sprouting into manhood when you're
      as old as I. A man ought to marry young, Bill. Hang the odds. I know what's
      good for you.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      At the hotel, while Webster shaved and arrayed himself in an immaculate
      white duck suit, with a broad black silk belt, buck shoes, and a Panama
      hat. Billy sent a note to Dolores, apprising her that John Stuart Webster
      had arrived&mdash;and would she be good enough to receive them?
    </p>
    <p>
      Miss Ruey would be that gracious. She was waiting for them in the veranda
      just off the <i>patio</i>, outwardly calm, but inwardly a foment of
      conflicting emotions. As they approached she affected not to see them and
      turning, glanced in the opposite direction; nor did she move her head
      until Billy's voice, speaking at her elbow, said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, Dolores, here's my old Jack-partner waiting to be
      introduced. Jack, permit me to present Miss Dolores Ruey.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      She turned her face and rose graciously, marking with secret triumph the
      light of recognition that; leaped to his eyes, hovered there the hundredth
      part of a second and departed, leaving those keen, quizzical blue orbs
      appraising her in the most natural manner imaginable. Webster bowed. .
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is a great happiness to meet you, Miss Ruey,&rdquo; he said
      gravely.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dolores gave him her hand. &ldquo;You have doubtless forgotten, Mr.
      Webster, but I think we have met before.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Indeed!&rdquo; John Stuart Webster murmured interestedly. &ldquo;So
      stupid of me not to remember. Where did we meet?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He has a profound sense of humour,&rdquo; she soliloquized. &ldquo;He's
      going to force me into the open. Oh, dear, I'm helpless.&rdquo;
      Aloud she said: &ldquo;On the train in Death Valley last month, Mr.
      Webster. You came aboard with whiskers.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Webster shook his head slowly, as if mystified. &ldquo;I fear you're
      mistaken, Miss Ruey. I cannot recall the meeting, and if I ever wore
      whiskers, no human being would ever be able to recognize me without them.
      Besides, I wasn't on the train in Death Valley last month. I was in
      Denver&mdash;so you must have met some other Mr. Webster.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      She flushed furiously. &ldquo;I didn't think I could be mistaken,&rdquo;
      she answered a trifle coldly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is my misfortune that you were,&rdquo; he replied graciously.
      &ldquo;Certainly, had we met at that time, I should not have failed to
      recognize you now. Somehow, Miss Ruey, I never have any luck.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      She was completely outgeneralled, and having the good sense to realize it,
      submitted gracefully. &ldquo;He's perfectly horrible,&rdquo; she
      told herself, &ldquo;but at least he can lie like a gentleman&mdash;and I
      always did like that kind of man.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      So they chatted on the veranda until luncheon was announced and Dolores
      left them to go to her room.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well?&rdquo; Billy queried the moment she was out of earshot.
      &ldquo;What do you think, Johnny?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think,&rdquo; said John Stuart Webster slowly, &ldquo;that you're
      a good picker, Bill. She's my ideal of a fine young woman, and my
      advice to you is to marry her. I'll grub-stake you. Bill, this stiff
      collar is choking me; I wish you'd wait here while I go to my room
      and rustle up a soft one.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      In the privacy of his room John Stuart Webster sat down on his bed and
      held his head in his hands, for he had just received a blow in the solar
      plexus and was still groggy; there was an ache in his head, and the
      quizzical light had faded from his eyes. Presently, however, he pulled
      himself together and approaching the mirror looked long at his
      weather-beaten countenance.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Too old,&rdquo; he murmured, &ldquo;too old to be dreaming dreams.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He changed to a soft collar, and when he descended to the <i>patio</i> to
      join Billy once more he was, to all outward appearances, his usual
      unperturbed self, for his was one of those rare natures that can derive a
      certain comfort from the misery of self-sacrifice&mdash;and in that five
      minutes alone in his room John Stuart Webster had wrestled with the
      tragedy of his life and won.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had resolved to give Billy the right of way on the highway to
      happiness.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XV
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">L</span>ATE in the
      afternoon of the day of his arrival in Buenaventura, in the cool recess of
      the deep veranda flanking the western side of the <i>patio</i> of the
      Hotel Mateo, John Stuart Webster sat in a wicker chair, cigar in mouth,
      elbows on knees, hands clasping a light Malacca stick, with the end of
      which he jabbed meditatively at a crack in the recently sprinkled tiled
      floor, as if punctuating each bitter thought that chased its predecessor
      through his somewhat numbed brain.
    </p>
    <p>
      In Mr. Webster's own whimsical phraseology, his clock had been
      fixed, on the instant he recognized in the object of his youthful partner's
      adoration the same winsome woman he had enthroned in his own secret castle
      of love. From that precise second Billy's preserve was as safe from
      encroachment by his friend as would be a bale of Confederate currency in
      an armour-steel vault on the three-thousand-foot level of a water-filled
      mine. Unfortunately for Webster, however, while he knew himself fairly
      well, he was not aware of this at the time. Viewed in the light of calmer
      reflection, Mr. Webster was quite certain he had made a star-spangled
      monkey of himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      He sought solace now in the fact that there had been mitigating
      circumstances. Throughout the entire journey from the steamer to the
      hotel, Billy had not once mentioned in its entirety the name of his adored
      one. In any Spanish-American country the name Dolores is not so uncommon
      as to excite suspicion; and Webster who had seen the mercurial William in
      and out of many a desperate love affair in the latter's brittle
      teens and early twenties, attached so little importance to this latest
      outbreak of the old disease that it did not occur to him to cross-examine
      Billy, after eliciting the information that the young man had not lost his
      heart to a local belle.
    </p>
    <p>
      The knowledge that Billy's inamorata was an American girl served to
      clear what threatened to be a dark atmosphere, and so Webster promptly had
      dismissed the subject.
    </p>
    <p>
      Any psychologist will tell one that it is quite possible for a person to
      dream, in the short space of a split second, of events which, if really
      consummated, would involve the passage of days, weeks, months, or even
      years! Now, Jack Webster was an extra fast thinker, asleep or awake, and
      in his mind's eye, as he sat there in the <i>patio</i>, he had a
      dreadful vision of himself with a delicate spray of lilies of the valley
      in the lapel of his dress coat, as he supported the malarial Billy to the
      altar, there to receive the promise of Dolores to love, honour, and obey
      until death them did part. As the said Billy's dearest friend and
      business associate&mdash;as the only logical single man available&mdash;the
      job was Webster's without a struggle. <i>Diablo!</i> Why did people
      persist in referring to such runners-up in the matrimonial handicap as <i>best</i>
      men, when at the very least calculation the groom was the winner?
    </p>
    <p>
      That wedding party was the very least of the future events Mr. Webster's
      hectic imagination conjured up. In the course of time (he reflected), a
      baby would doubtless arrive to bless the Geary household. Godfather? John
      Stuart Webster, of course. And when the fruit of that happy union should
      be old enough to &ldquo;ride horsey,&rdquo; who but the family friend
      would be required to get down on all fours and accommodate the unconscious
      tyrant? Boy or girl, it would make no difference; whichever way the cat
      jumped, he would be known as Uncle Jack; Billy would drag him up to the
      house once or twice a week, and he would go for the sake of the baby; then
      they would make him stay all night, and Mrs. Billy would sigh and try to
      smile when she detected cigarette ashes on the chiffonier in the spare
      bedroom&mdash;infallible sign that there was a bachelor about. Besides,
      happily married women have a mania for marrying off their husband's
      bachelor friends, and Mrs. Billy might scout up a wife for him&mdash;a
      wife he didn't want&mdash;and&mdash;&mdash;No, he would <i>not</i>
      be the family friend. Nobody should ever Uncle Jack him if he could help
      it, and the only way to avoid the honour would be to eschew the job of
      best man, to resolve, in the very beginning of things, to beware of
      entangling friendships. Thus, as in a glass darkly, John Stuart Webster,
      in one illuminating moment, saw his future, together with his sole avenue
      of escape.
    </p>
    <p>
      All too forcibly Webster realized that Billy's bally-hooing must
      have created a favourable impression in Dolores's mind prior to the
      arrival of the victim; hence it seemed reasonable to presume that when she
      discovered in Billy Geary's Jack Webster her own soiled, ragged,
      bewhiskered, belligerent, battered knight, Sir John Stuart Webster of
      Death Valley, California, U. S. A., extreme measures would have to be
      taken instantly to save the said Webster from being spattered with a dear
      old friendship in the future&mdash;and a dear old friendship with Dolores
      Ruey was something he did not want, had never figured on, and shuddered at
      accepting. All things considered, it had appeared wise to him to
      challenge, politely but firmly, her suggestion that they had met.
    </p>
    <p>
      Of course, Webster had not really thought all this at the time; he had
      felt it and acted entirely upon instinct. A little private cogitation,
      however, had served to straighten out his thinking apparatus and-convince
      him that he had acted hastily&mdash;wherefore he would (a still, small
      voice whispered) repent at leisure. Dolores had not pressed the question
      (he was grateful to her for that), and for as long as five minutes he had
      congratulated himself on his success in &ldquo;putting it over&rdquo; on
      her. Then he had caught her scrutinizing the knuckles of his right hand;
      following her glance, he had seen that the crests of two knuckles were
      slightly bluish and tender, as new skin has a habit of showing on tanned
      knuckles. With a sinking heart he had recalled how painfully and deeply he
      had lacerated those knuckles less than a month before on the strong white
      teeth of a fat male masher, and while the last ugly shred of evidence had
      dropped off a week before, nevertheless to the critical and discerning eye
      there was still faint testimony of that fateful joust&mdash;just
      sufficient to convict!
    </p>
    <p>
      He had glanced at her swiftly; she had caught the glance and replied to it
      with the faintest possible gleam of mischievous challenge in her glorious
      brown orbs; whereupon John Stuart Webster had immediately done what every
      honest male biped has been doing since Adam told his first lie to Eve&mdash;blushed,
      and had drawn a little taunting smile for his pains.
    </p>
    <p>
      As Solomon once remarked, the wicked flee when no man pursueth; and that
      smile had scarcely faded before John Stuart Webster had unanimously
      resolved upon the course he should have pursued in the first place. He
      would investigate Billy's mining concession immediately; provided it
      should prove worth while, he would finance it and put the property on a
      paying basis; after which he would see to it that the very best doctors in
      the city of Buenaventura should inform Billy, unofficially and in the
      strictest confidence, that if he desired to preserve the life of Senor
      Juan Webstaire, he should forthwith pack that rapidly disintegrating
      person off to a more salubrious climate.
    </p>
    <p>
      Having made his decision, John Stuart Webster immediately took heart of
      hope and decided to lead trumps. He leaned over and slapped Billy Geary's
      knee affectionately.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, Bill, you saffron-coloured old wreck, how long do you suppose
      it will take for you to pick up enough strength and courage to do some
      active mining? You're looking like food shot from guns.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Billy needs a vacation and a change of climate,&rdquo; Dolores
      declared with that motherly conviction all womankind feels toward a sick
      man.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So I do, Dolores,&rdquo; Billy replied. &ldquo;And I'm going
      to take it. Up there in the hills back of San Miguel de Padua, the
      ubiquitous mosquito is not, the climate is almost temperate&mdash;and
      'tis there that I would be.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You can't start too soon to please me, Billy,&rdquo; Webster
      declared. &ldquo;I'm anxious to get that property on a paying basis,
      so I can get out of the country.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, Johnny,&rdquo; the amazed Billy declared, &ldquo;I thought you
      would stay and help run the mine.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Indeed! Well, why do you suppose I spent so much time teaching you
      how to run a mine, you young idiot, if not against just such a time as
      this? You found this concession and tied it up; I'll finance it and
      help you get everything started; but after that, I'm through, and
      you can manage it on salary and name the salary yourself. You have a
      greater interest in this country than I, William; and so with your kind
      permission we'll hike up to that concession tomorrow and give it the
      double-O; then, if I can O. K. the property, we'll cable for the
      machinery I ordered just before I left Denver, and get busy. We ought to
      have our first clean-up within ninety days. What kind of labour have you
      in this country? Anything worth while? If not, we'll have to import
      some white men that can do things.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Gosh, but you're in a hurry,&rdquo; Billy murmured. He had
      been long enough in Sobrante to have acquired a touch of the <i>manana</i>
      spirit of the lowlands, and he disliked exceedingly the thought of having
      his courtship interrupted on a minute's notice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You know me, son. I'm a hustler on the job,&rdquo; Webster
      reminded him brutally; &ldquo;so the sooner you start, the sooner you can
      get back and accumulate more malaria. What accommodations have you up
      there?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;None, Jack.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then you had better get some, Billy. I think you told me we have to
      take horses at San Miguel de Padua to ride in to the mine.&rdquo; Billy
      nodded. &ldquo;Then you had better buy a tent and bedding for both of us,
      ship the stuff up to San Miguel de Padua, go up with it and engage horses,
      a good cook, and a couple of reliable <i>mozos</i>. When you have
      everything ready, telegraph me and I'll come up.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why can't you come up with me?&rdquo; Billy demanded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have to see a man, and write some letters and send a cablegram
      and wait for an answer. I may have to loaf around here for two or three
      days. By the way, what did you do for that friend I sent to letter of
      introduction?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Exactly what you told me to do, Johnny&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where is he now?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;At El Buen Amigo&mdash;the same place where I'm living.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All right. We'll not discuss business any more, because we
      have finished with the business in hand&mdash;at least I have, Billy. When
      you get back to your hostelry, you might tell my friend I shall expect him
      over to dine with me this evening, if he can manage it.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      For an hour they discussed various subjects; then Billy, declaring the
      siesta was almost over and the shops reopening as a consequence, announced
      his intention of doing his shopping, said good-bye to Dolores and Webster,
      and lugubriously departed on the business in hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why are you in such a hurry, Mr. Webster?&rdquo; Dolores demanded.
      &ldquo;You haven't been in Buenaventura six hours until you've
      managed to make me perfectly miserable.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm terribly sorry. I didn't mean to.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Didn't you know Billy Geary is my personal property?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, but I suspected he might be. Bill's generous that way. He
      never hesitates to give himself to a charming woman.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This was a case of mutual self-defense. Billy hasn't any
      standing socially, you know. I believe he has been seen shooting craps&mdash;isn't
      that what you call it?&mdash;with gentlemen of more or less colour; then
      he appeared in public with me, minus a chaperon&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Fooey!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Likewise fiddlesticks! I should have had the <i>entrée</i> to the
      society of my father's old friends but for that; when old Mrs.
      General Maldonado lectured me (the dear, aristocratic soul conceived it to
      be her duty) on the impropriety of appearing on the Male-con with Billy
      and my guardian, who happens to be Billy's landlady, I tried to
      explain our American brand of democracy, but failed. So I haven't
      been invited anywhere since, and life would have been very dull without
      Billy. He has been a dear&mdash;and you have taken him away.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Webster laughed. &ldquo;Well, be patient, Miss Ruey, and I'll give
      him back to you with considerably more money than he will require for your
      joint comfort. Billy in financial distress is a joy forever, but Billy in
      a top hat and a frock coat on the sunny side of Easy Street will be
      absolutely irresistible.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He's a darling. Ever since my arrival he has dedicated his
      life to keeping me amused.&rdquo; She rose. &ldquo;Despite your
      wickedness, Mr. Webster, I am going to be good to you. Billy and I always
      have five o'clock tea here in the veranda. Would you care to come to
      my tea-party?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing could give me greater pleasure,&rdquo; he assured her.
    </p>
    <p>
      She nodded brightly to him. &ldquo;I'm going to run up to my room
      and put some powder on my nose,&rdquo; she explained.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you'll return before five o'clock?&rdquo; Webster
      was amazed to hear himself plead.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You do not deserve such consideration, but I'll come back in
      about twenty minutes,&rdquo; she answered and left him in the spot where
      we find him at the opening of this chapter, in pensive mood, jabbing his
      Malacca stick into a crack in the tiled floor.
    </p>
    <p>
      Presently Webster shuddered. &ldquo;Good heavens,&rdquo; he soliloquized,
      &ldquo;what a jackass-play I made when I declined to admit we had met
      before. What harm could I have accomplished by admitting it? I must be
      getting old, because I'm getting cowardly. I'm afraid of
      myself! When I met that girl last month, it was in a region that God
      forgot&mdash;and I was a human caterpillar, which a caterpillar is a
      hairy, lowly, unlovely thing that crawls until it is metamorphosed into a
      butterfly and flies. Following out the simile, I am now a human butterfly,
      not recognizable as the caterpillar to one woman out of ten million; yet
      she pegs me out at first. Gad, but she's a remarkable girl! And now
      I'm in for it. I've aroused her curiosity; and being a woman,
      she will not rest until she has fathomed the reason back of my
      extraordinary conduct. I think I'm going to be smeared with
      confusion. A spineless man like you, Johnny Webster, stands as much show
      in a battle of wits with that woman as a one-legged white man at a coon
      cakewalk. I'm afraid of her, and I'm afraid of myself. I'm
      glad I'm going up to the mine. I'll go as quickly as I can,
      and stay as long as I can.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      As Webster viewed the situation, his decision to see as little as possible
      of Dolores during his brief stay in Sobrante was a wise one. The less he
      saw of her (he told himself), the better for his peace of mind, for he was
      forty years old, and he had never loved before. For him this fever that
      burned in his blood, this delicious agony that throbbed in his heart&mdash;and
      all on the very ghost of provocation&mdash;were so many danger-signals,
      heralds of that grand passion which, coming to a man of forty, generally
      lasts him the remainder of his natural existence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This certainly beats the Dutch!&rdquo; he murmured, and beyond the
      peradventure of a doubt, it did. He reflected that all of his life the
      impulses of his generous nature had been his undoing. In an excess of
      paternalism he had advised Billy to marry the girl and not permit himself
      to develop into a homeless, childless, loveless man such as Exhibit A,
      there present; following his natural inclination to play any game,'
      red or black, he had urged Billy to marry the girl immediately and had
      generously offered a liberal subsidy to make the marriage possible, for he
      disliked any interference in his plans to make those he loved happy. And
      now&mdash;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      Webster was forced to admit he was afraid of himself. His was the rapidly
      disappearing code of the old unfettered West, that a man shall never
      betray his friend in thought, word, or deed. To John Stuart Webster any
      crime against friendship was the most heinous in all the calendar of human
      frailty; even to dream of slipping into Billy's shoes now would be
      monstrous; yet Webster knew he could not afford a test of strength between
      his ancient friendship for Billy and his masculine desire for a perfect
      mate. Remained then but one course:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I must run like a road-runner,&rdquo; was the way Webster expressed
      it.

    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">D</span>OLORES had been
      gone an hour before Webster roused from his bitter introspection
      sufficiently to glance at his watch. &ldquo;Hum-m-m!&rdquo; he grunted
      disapprovingly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I've been here fully half an hour,&rdquo; Dolores's
      voice assured him. He turned guiltily and found her leaning against the

      so captivated him the first time he saw her.

      &ldquo;Well, then&rdquo;&mdash;bluntly&mdash;&ldquo;why didn't you
      say so?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The surest way to get oneself disliked is to intrude on the moods
      of one's friends. Moreover, I wanted to study you in repose. Are you
      quite finished talking to yourself and fighting imaginary enemies? If so,
      you might talk to me for a change; I'll even disagree with you on
      any subject, if opposition will make you any happier.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He rose and indicated the chair. &ldquo;Please sit down, Miss Ruey. You
      are altogether disconcerting&mdash;too confoundedly smart. I fear I'm
      going to be afraid of you until I know you better.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      She shrugged adorably and took the proffered chair. &ldquo;That's
      the Latin in her&mdash;that shrug,&rdquo; Webster thought. &ldquo;I wonder
      what other mixtures go to make up that perfect whole.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Aloud he said: &ldquo;So you wanted to study me in repose? Why waste your
      time? I am never in repose.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Feminine curiosity, Mr. Webster. Billy has talked so much of you
      that I wanted to see if you measured up to the specifications.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't mind your looking at me, Miss Ruey, but I get fidgety
      when you look through me.&rdquo; He was glad he said that, because it made
      her laugh&mdash;more immoderately, Webster thought, than the circumstances
      demanded. Nevertheless he had an insane desire to make her laugh like that
      again, to watch her mobile features run the gamut from sweet, nunlike
      repose to mirthful riot.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can't help it&mdash;really,&rdquo; she protested. &ldquo;You're
      so transparent.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Webster reflected that doubtless she was right. Men in his fix
      generally were pitifully obvious. Nevertheless he was nettled. &ldquo;Oh,
      I'm not so sure of that. I was just accusing myself of being a
      bonehead, and bone is opaque.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps I have an X-ray eye,&rdquo; she replied demurely. &ldquo;However,
      just to show you how easy you are to read, I'll not look at your
      silly head. Just let me have your hand, and I'll tell you all about
      yourself.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is there any charge?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, a nominal one. However, I guarantee a truthful reading; if,
      when I am through, you are not wholly satisfied, you do not have to pay
      the price. Is that a satisfactory arrangement?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Right as a fox,&rdquo; he declared, and held out his great
      calloused hand. He thrilled as she took it in both of hers, so soft and
      beautiful, and flattened it out, palm upward, on her knee. &ldquo;A fine,
      large, useful hand,&rdquo; she commented musingly. &ldquo;The callouses
      indicate recent hard manual toil with a pick land shovel; despite your
      recent efforts with soap and brush and pumice-stone, there still remain
      evidences of some foreign matter ingrained in those callous spots. While,
      of course, I cannot be certain of my diagnosis without a magnifying glass,
      I venture the conjecture that it is a mineral substance, and your hands
      are so tanned one can readily see you have been working in the sun&mdash;in
      a very hot sun, as a matter of fact. Inasmuch as the hottest sun I ever
      felt was in Death Valley, as I crossed it on the train last month, your
      hand tells me you have been there.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The general structure of the hand indicates that you are of a
      peace-loving disposition, but are far from being a peace-at-any-price
      advocate.&rdquo; She flipped his hand over suddenly. &ldquo;Ah, the
      knuckles confirm that last statement. They tell me you will fight on
      provocation; while your fingers are still stiff and thick from your recent
      severe labours, nevertheless they indicate an artistic nature, from which
      I deduce that upon the occasion when you were in conflict last your
      opponent received a most artistic thrashing.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Webster twitched nervously. &ldquo;Skip the coarse side of my nature,&rdquo;
      he pleaded, &ldquo;and tell me something nice about myself.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am coming to that. This line indicates that you are very brave,
      gentle, and courteous. You are quick and firm in your decisions, but not
      always right, because your actions are governed by your heart instead of
      your head. Once you have made a decision, you are reckless of the
      consequences. Your lifeline tells me you are close to fifty-three years of
      age&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Seeress, you're shooting high and to the right,&rdquo; he
      interrupted, for he did not relish that jab about his age. &ldquo;I'll
      have you know I was forty years old last month, and that I can still do a
      hundred yards in twelve seconds flat&mdash;in my working clothes.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, don't feel peeved about it, Mr. Webster. I am not
      infallible; the best you can hope for from me is a high percentage of
      hits, even if I did shoot high and to the right that time. In point of
      worldly experience you're a hundred and six years old but I lopped
      off fifty per cent, to be on the safe side. To continue: You are of an
      extremely chivalrous nature&mdash;particularly toward young ladies
      travelling without chaperons; you are kind, affectionate, generous to a
      fault, something of a spendthrift. You will always be a millionaire or a
      pauper, never anything between&mdash;at least for any great length of
      time.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You've been talking to that callow Bill Geary.&rdquo; Mr.
      Webster's face was so red he was sensible of a distinct feeling of
      relief that she kept her face bent over his hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I haven't. He's been talking to me. One may safely
      depend upon you to do the unexpected. Your matrimonial line is unbroken,
      proving you have never married, although right here the line is somewhat
      dim and frayed.&rdquo; She looked up at him suddenly. &ldquo;You haven't
      been in love, have you?&rdquo; she queried with childlike insouciance.
      &ldquo;In love&mdash;and disappointed?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He nodded, for he could not trust himself to speak.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How sad!&rdquo; she cooed sympathetically. &ldquo;Did she marry
      another, or did she die?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She&mdash;she&mdash;yes, she died.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Cauliflower-tongue, in all probability, carried her off, poor
      thing! However, to your fortune: You are naturally truthful and would not
      make a deliberate misstatement of fact unless you had a very potent reason
      for it. You are sensitive to ridicule; it irks you to be teased,
      particularly by a woman, although you would boil in oil rather than admit
      it. You never ask impertinent questions, and you dislike those who do; you
      are not inquisitive; you never question other people's motives
      unless they appear to have a distinct bearing on your happiness or
      prosperity; you resent it when anybody questions your motives, and anybody
      who knows your nature will not question them. However, you have a strong
      sense of sportsmanship, and when fairly defeated, whether in a battle of
      fists or a battle of wits, you never hold a grudge, which is one of the
      very nicest characteristics a man can have&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Or a woman,&rdquo; he suggested feebly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Quite right. Few woman have a sense of sportsmanship.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How do you know?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The witness declines to answer, on the ground that he might
      incriminate himself; also I object to the question because it is
      irrelevant, immaterial, and not cross-examination.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Accepted. You stand a very good chance of becoming a millionaire in
      Sobrante, but you must beware of a dark man who has crossed your path&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Which one?&rdquo; Webster queried mirthfully. &ldquo;All coons look
      alike to me&mdash;Greasers also.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mere patter of our profession, Mr. Webster,&rdquo; she admitted,
      &ldquo;tossed in to build up the mystery element and simulate wisdom.
      Fortune awaited you in the United States, but you put it behind you, at
      the call of friendship, for a fortune in Sobrante. Now you have
      reconsidered that foolish action and at this moment you are contemplating
      sending a cablegram to a fat old man who waddles when he walks, recalling
      your decision not to accept a certain proposition of a business nature.
      However, you are too late. The fat old man with the waddle has made other
      arrangements, and if you want to make money, you'll remain in
      Sobrante. I think that is all, Mr. Webster.&rdquo; He was gazing at her
      with an expression composed of equal parts of awe, amazement,
      consternation, adoration, and blank stupidity.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; she queried innocently, &ldquo;to quote Billy's
      colloquial style: did I put it over?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You did very well for an amateur, but I'm a doubting Thomas.
      I have to poke my finger into the wound, so to speak, before I'll
      believe. About this fat old man who waddles when he walks: a really
      topnotch palmist could tell me his name.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I'm only an amateur, but still I think I might, to
      quote Billy again, make a stab at it. A little while ago you said I had a
      strong sense of sportsmanship. Do you care to bet me about ten dollars I
      cannot give you the fat party's initials&mdash;all three of them?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He gazed at her owlishly. She was the most perfectly amazing girl he had
      ever met; he was certain she would win the ten dollars from him, but then
      it was worth ten dollars to know for a certainty whether she was perfect
      or possessed of a slight flaw; so he silently drew forth a wallet that
      would have choked a cow and skinned off a ten-dollar gold certificate of
      the United States of America.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm game,&rdquo; he mumbled. &ldquo;To quote Billy again:
      'Put up or shut up.'&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The fat gentleman's initials are E. P. J.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By the twelve apostles, Peter, Simon&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don't blaspheme, Mr. Webster.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He stood up and shook himself. &ldquo;When you order the tea,&rdquo; he
      said very distinctly, &ldquo;please have mine cold. I need a bracer after
      that. Take the ten. You've won it.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thanks ever so much,&rdquo; she answered in a matter-of-fact tone
      and tucked the bill inside of her shirtwaist. &ldquo;I am a very poor
      woman and&mdash;'Every little bit added to what you've got
      makes just a little bit more,'&rdquo; she carolled, swaying her
      lithe, beautiful body and snapping her fingers like a cabaret dancer.
    </p>
    <p>
      He could have groaned with the futility of his overwhelming desire for
      her; it even occurred to him what a shame it was to waste a marvel like
      her on a callow young pup like Billy, who had fought so many deadly
      skirmishes with Dan Cupid that a post-impressionistic painting of the
      Geary heart must resemble a pincushion. Then he remembered that this was
      an ungenerous, a traitorous thought, and that he had not paid the lady her
      fee.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, what's the tariff?&rdquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You really feel that I have earned a professional's fee?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Beyond a doubt.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      She stood a moment gazing thoughtfully down at the tip of her little toe,
      struggling to be quite cool and collected in the knowledge that she was
      about to do a daring, almost a brazen thing&mdash;wondering with a queer,
      panicky little fluttering of her heart if <i>he</i> would think any the
      less of her for it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well&mdash;I&mdash;that is&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The cauliflower ear is not unknown among pugilists in our own dear
      native land, but the cauliflower tongue appears to blossom exclusively in
      Sobrante,&rdquo; he suggested wickedly.
    </p>
    <p>
      She bit her lips to repress a smile. &ldquo;Since you have taken Billy
      away from me this evening, I shall make you take Billy's place this
      evening. After dinner you shall hire an open victoria with two little
      white horses and drive me around the Malecon. There is a band concert
      to-night.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If it's the last act of my wicked life!&rdquo; he promised
      fervently. Strange to relate, in that ecstatic moment no thought of Billy
      Geary marred the perfect serenity of what promised to be the most
      perfectly serene night in history.

      CHAPTER XVII
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">T</span>HEY were seated at
      the tiny tea table when the sound of feet crunching the little shell-paved
      path through the <i>patio</i> caused Webster and Dolores to turn their
      heads simultaneously. Coming toward them was an individual who wore upon a
      head of flaming red a disreputable, conical-crowned straw sombrero; a
      soiled cotton camisa with the tails flowing free of his equally soiled
      khaki trousers, and sandals of the kind known as <i>alpargates</i>&mdash;made
      from the tough fibre of a plant of the cactus family and worn only by the
      very lowliest peons&mdash;completed his singular attire.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hello!&rdquo; Webster murmured whimsically. &ldquo;Look who's
      here!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;One of Billy's friends and another reason why he has no
      social standing,&rdquo; Dolores whispered. &ldquo;I believe he's
      going to speak to us.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Such evidently appeared to be the man's intention. He came to the
      edge of the veranda, swept his ruin of a hat from his red head and bowed
      with Castilian expansiveness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yer pardon, Miss, for appearin' before you.&rdquo; She smiled
      her forgiveness to what Webster how perceived to be an alcoholic wreck. He
      was about to dismiss the fellow with scant ceremony, when Dolores, with
      that rich sense of almost masculine humour&mdash;a humour that was
      distinctly American&mdash;said sweetly:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Webster, shake hands with Don Juan Cafetéro, <i>bon vivant</i>
      and man about town. Don Juan, permit me to present Mr. Webster, from
      somewhere in the United States. Mr. Webster is a mining partner of our
      mutual friend Mr. William Geary.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      A long, sad descent into the Pit had, however, imbued Don Juan with a
      sense of his degradation; he was in the presence of a superior, and he
      acknowledged the introduction with a respectful inclination of his head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Tis you I've called to see, Misther Webster, sor,&rdquo;
      he explained.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very well, old-timer. In what way can I be of service to you?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Tis the other way around, sor, if ye plaze, an' for
      that same there's no charrge, seein' ye're the partner,
      av that fine, kind gintleman, Misther Geary Sure 'tis he that's
      the free-handed lad wit' his money whin he has it, God bless him, an'
      may the heavens be his bed, although be the same token I can see wit'
      the half av an eye that 'tis yerself thinks nothin' av a
      dollar, or five, for that matther. However, sor, that's neither here
      nor there. Did ye, whilst in New Orleans, have d'alings wit' a
      short, shtout spiggoty wit' a puckered scar undher his right eye?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      John Stuart Webster suddenly sat up straight and gazed upon the lost son
      of Erin with grave interest. &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he replied, &ldquo;I seem
      to recall such a man.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Only another proof of my ability as a palmist,&rdquo; Dolores
      struck in. &ldquo;Remember, Mr. Webster, I warned you to beware of a dark
      man that had crossed your path.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;An' well he may, Miss&mdash;well he may,&rdquo; Don Juan
      agreed gloomily. &ldquo;'Tis none av me business, sor, but would ye
      mind tellin' me just what ye did to that spiggoty?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, to begin, last Sunday morning I interrupted this pucker-eyed
      fellow and a pop-eyed friend of his while engaged in an attempt to
      assassinate a white, inoffensive stranger. The following day, at the
      gangplank of the steamer, we met again; he poked his nose into my
      business, so I squeezed his nose until he cried; right before everybody I
      did it, Don Juan, and to add insult to injury, I plucked a few hairs from
      his rat's moustache&mdash;one hair per each pluck.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'd a notion ye did somethin' to him, sor. Now, thin,
      listen to me: I'm not much to look at, but I'm white. I'm
      an attashay, as ye might say, av Ignatz Leber&mdash;him that do have the
      import an' export house at the ind av the Calle San Rosario,
      forninst the bay. Also he do have charrge av the cable office, an'
      whin I'm sober enough, I deliver cable-grains for Leber. Now, thin,
      ye'll recall we had a bit av a shower to-day at noon?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Dolores and Webster nodded. Don Juan, after glancing cautiously around,
      lowered his voice and continued: &ldquo;I was deliverin' a cablegram
      for Leber, an' me course took me past the palace gate&mdash;which,
      be the same token, has sinthry-boxes both inside an' out, wan on
      each side av the gate. The sinthry was not visible as I came along, an'
      what wit' the shower comin' as suddint as that, an' me
      wit' a wardrobe that's not so extinsive I can afford to get it
      wet, I shtepped into wan av the outside sintry-boxes till the rain should
      be over, an' what wit' a dhrink av <i>aguardiente</i> I'd
      took to brace me for the thrip, an' the mimory av auld times, I fell
      asleep.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dear knows how long I sat there napping; all I know is that I was
      awakened by the sound av three men talkin' at the gate, an'
      divil a worrd did they say but what I heard. They were talkin' in
      Spanish, but I undhershtood thim well enough. 'He's at the
      Hotel Mateo,' says wan voice, 'an' his name is Webster&mdash;Jawn
      Webster. He's an American, an' a big, savage-lookin' lad
      at that, so take, me advice an' be careful. Do ye two keep an eye on
      him wherever he goes, an' if he should shtep out at night an'
      wandher t'rough a dark shtreet, do ye two see to it that he's
      put where he'll not interfere again in Don Felipe's affairs.
      No damn' gringo'&mdash;beggin' yer pardon, Miss&mdash;'can
      intherfere in the wurrk av the Intilligince Bureau at a time like this, in
      addition to insultin' our honoured chief, wit'out the
      necessity av bein' measured for a coffin.' '<i>Si, mi
      general.'</i> says another lad, an 'To be sure, <i>mi general</i>,'
      says a thirrd; an' wit' that the gineral, bad cess to him,
      wint back to the palace an' the other two walked on up the <i>calle</i>
      an' away from the sinthry-box.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did you come out and follow them?&rdquo; Webster demanded briskly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Faith, I did. Wan av them is Francisco Arredondo, a young cavalry
      lootinint, an' the other wan is Captain José Benevides, him that do
      be the best pistol-shot an' swordsman in the spiggoty army. 'Twas
      him that kilt auld Gineral Gonzales in a djuel a month ago.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What kind of looking man is this Benevides, my friend?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A tall, thin young man, wit' a dude's moustache an'
      a diamond ring on his right hand. He do be whiter nor most. Have a care
      would ye meet him around the city an' let him pick a fight wit'
      ye. An' have a care, sor, would ye go out av a night.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank you, Don Juan. You're the soul of kindness. What else
      do you know?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; Don Juan replied with a naïve grin, &ldquo;I did know
      somethin' else, but shure, Misther Geary advised me to forget it. I
      was wit' him in the launch last night.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Webster stepped out of the veranda and laid a friendly hand on Don Juan
      Cafetéro's shoulder. &ldquo;Don Juan,&rdquo; he said gently, &ldquo;I'm
      going back to the United States very soon. Would you like to come with me?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Don Juan's watery eyes grew a shade mistier, if possible. He shook
      his head. &ldquo;Whin I'm dhrunk here, sor,&rdquo; he replied,
      &ldquo;no wan pays any attintion to me, but in America they'd give
      me ten days in the hoosgow wanst a week. Thank you, sor, but I'll
      shtay here till the finish.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There axe institutions in America where hopeless inebriates,
      self-committed, may be sent for a couple of years. I believe 6 per cent,
      are permanently cured. You could be one of the six&mdash;and I'd
      cheerfully pay for it and give you a good job when you come out.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Don Juan Cafetéro shook his red head hopelessly. He knew the strength of
      the Demon and had long since ceased to fight even a rear-guard action.
      Webster put a hand under the stubbly chin and tilted Don Juan's head
      sharply. &ldquo;Hold up your head,&rdquo; he commanded. &ldquo;You're
      the first of your breed I ever saw who would admit he was whipped. Here's
      five dollars for you&mdash;five dollars gold. Take it and return with the
      piece intact to-morrow morning, Don Juan Cafetéro.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Don Juan Cafetéro's wondering glance met Webster's directly,
      wavered, sought the ground, but at a jerk on his chin came back and&mdash;stayed.
      Thus for at least ten seconds they gazed at each other; then Webster
      spoke. &ldquo;Thank you,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Me name is John J. Cafferty,&rdquo; the lost one quavered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Round one for Cafferty,&rdquo; Webster laughed. &ldquo;Good-bye
      now, until nine tomorrow. I'll expect you here, John, without fail.&rdquo;
      And he took the derelict's hand and wrung it heartily.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; Webster remarked to Dolores as he held out his cup for
      more tea, &ldquo;if I'm not the original Tumble Tom, I hope I may
      never see the back of my neck.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you attach any importance to Don Juan's story?&rdquo; she
      asked anxiously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, but not so much as Don Juan does. However, to be forewarned is
      to be forearmed.&rdquo; He sighed. &ldquo;I am the innocent bystander,&rdquo;
      he explained, &ldquo;and I greatly fear I have managed to snarl myself up
      in a Sobrantean political intrigue, when I haven't the slightest
      interest either way. However, that's only one more reason why I
      should finish my work here and get back to Denver.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But how did all this happen, Mr. Webster?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Like shooting fish in a dry lake, Miss Ruey,&rdquo; Webster
      replied, and related to her in detail the story of his adventure with the
      Sobrantean assassins in Jackson Square and his subsequent meeting with
      Andrew Bowers aboard <i>La Estrellita</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dolores laughed long and heartily as Webster finished his humorous
      recital. &ldquo;Oh, you're such a very funny man,&rdquo; she
      declared. &ldquo;Billy told me God only made one Jack Webster and then
      destroyed the mold; I believe Billy is right. But do tell me what became
      of this extraordinary and unbidden guest.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The night the steamer arrived in port, Billy and Don Juan came out
      in a launch to say 'Hello,' so I seized upon the opportunity
      to tell Andrew to jump overboard and swim to the launch. Gave him a little
      note to Billy&mdash;carried it in his mouth&mdash;instructing Billy to do
      the right thing by him&mdash;and Billy did it. I don't know what
      Andrew is up to and I don't care. Where I was raised we let every
      man roll his own hoop. All I hope is that they don't shoot Andrew.
      If they do, I fear I'll weep. He's certainly a skookum lad. Do
      you know, Miss Ruey, I love anybody that can impose on me&mdash;make a
      monkey out of me, in fact&mdash;and make me like it?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's so comforting,&rdquo; she remarked dryly. Webster
      looked at her sharply, suspiciously; her words were susceptible of a dual
      interpretation. Her next sentence, however, dissipated this impression.
      &ldquo;Because it confirms what I told you this afternoon when I read your
      palm,&rdquo; she added.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You didn't know how truly you spoke when you referred to the
      dark man that had crossed my path. He's uncomfortably real&mdash;drat
      him!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then you are really concerned?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not at all, but I purpose sleeping with one eye open. I shan't
      permit myself to feel concerned until they send more than two men after me&mdash;say
      eight or ten. A husky American ought to be willing to give these
      spiggoties a pull in the weights.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      His indifference appalled her; she leaned forward impulsively and laid a
      hand on his forearm. &ldquo;But you must heed Don Juan's warning,&rdquo;
      she declared seriously. &ldquo;You must not go out alone at night.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He grinned boyishly. &ldquo;Of course not, Miss Ruey. You're going
      to ride out with me this evening.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm not. Don Juan's report has spoiled all that. I'll
      not subject you to risk.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very well; then I shall drive out alone.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You're a despot, Mr. Webster&mdash;a regular despot.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Likewise a free agent.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'll go with you.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I thought so.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You're&mdash;you're&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He rose while she was searching for the right word. &ldquo;Will you excuse
      me until after dinner, Miss Ruey? I'd love to stay and chat with
      you, even though it does appear that presently we shall be calling each
      other names, but the fact of the matter is&mdash;well, I am in a very
      serious predicament, and I might as well start right now to prepare to
      meet any emergency. For what hour shall I order the carriage?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Seven-thirty. After all, they'll not dare to murder you on
      the Malecon.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I agree with you. It will have to be done very quietly, if at all.
      You've been mighty nice to me this afternoon, seeress; I shall be
      grateful right up to the moment of dissolution.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Speak softly but carry a big stick,&rdquo; she warned him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A big gun,&rdquo; he corrected here, &ldquo;&mdash;two of them, in
      fact.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sensible man! I'm not going to worry about you, Mr. Webster.&rdquo;
      She nodded her permission for him to retire, and as he walked down the
      veranda and into the hotel, her glance followed him with pardonable
      feminine curiosity, marking the breadth of his shoulders, the quick,
      springy stride, the alert, erect poise of his head on the powerful neck.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A doer of deeds are you, John Stuart Webster,&rdquo; she almost
      whispered. &ldquo;As Kipling would say: '<i>Wallah!</i> But you are
      a man!'&rdquo; ^
    </p>
    <p>
      A stealthy footstep sounded below the veranda she turned and beheld Don
      Juan Cafetéro, his hat in his left hand, in his right a gold-piece which
      he held toward her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Take it, <i>allanah</i>,&rdquo; he wheezed in his hoarse, drunkard's
      whisper. &ldquo;Keep it f'r me till to-morrow, for sorra wan av me
      can I trust to do that same&mdash;an' be the same token I can't
      face that big man wit'out it.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why not, Don Juan?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He hung his red head. &ldquo;I dunno, Miss,&rdquo; he replied miserably.
      &ldquo;Maybe 'tis on account av him&mdash;the eye av him&mdash;the
      way av him&mdash;divil such a man did I ever meet&mdash;God bless him!
      Shure, Misther Geary do be the fine lad, but he&mdash;he&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Geary never put a big forefinger under your chin and bade you
      hold up your head. Is that it?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Tis not what he did, Miss, but the way he did it. All the
      fiends av hell 'll be at me this night to shpend what he give me&mdash;and
      I&mdash;I'm afraid&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He broke off, mumbling and chattering like a man in the grip of a great
      terror. In his agony of body and spirit, Dolores could have wept for Don
      Juan Cafetéro, for in that supreme moment the derelict's soul was
      bare, revealing something pure and sweet and human, for all his
      degradation. How did Jack Webster know? wondered Dolores. And why did he
      so confidently give an order to this human flotsam and expect it to be
      obeyed? And why did Don Juan Cafetéro come whining to her for strength to
      help him obey it? Through the murk of her girlish unsophstication and
      scant knowledge of human nature these and other questions obtruded
      themselves, the while she gazed down at Don Juan's dirty, quivering
      hand that held the coin toward her. And presently the answer came&mdash;a
      quotation long since learned and forgotten:
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      Be noble&mdash;and the nobleness that lies in other men,
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      Sleeping but never dead,
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      Will rise in majesty to meet thine own.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will not spoil his handiwork,&rdquo; she told herself, and she
      stepped down off the veranda to a position directly in front of Don Juan.
      &ldquo;That wouldn't be playing the game,&rdquo; she told him.
      &ldquo;I can't help you deceive him. You are the first of your breed&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don't say it,&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;Didn't he tell me
      wanst?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then make the fight, Don&mdash;Mr. Cafferty.&rdquo; She lowered her
      voice. &ldquo;I am depending on you to stay sober and guard him. He needs
      a faithful friend so badly, now that Mr. Geary is away.&rdquo; She patted
      the grimy hand and left him staring at the ground. Presently he sighed,
      quivered horribly, and shambled out of the <i>patio</i> on to the
      firing-line. And when he reported to Jack Webster at nine o'clock
      next morning, he was sober, shaking horribly and on the verge of <i>delirium
      tremens</i>, but tightly clasped in his right hand he held that
      five-dollar piece. Dolores, who had made it her business to be present at
      the interview, heard John Stuart Webster say heartily:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The finest thing about a terrible fight, friend Cafferty, is that
      if it is a worth-while battle, the spoils of victory are exceedingly
      sweet. You are how about to enjoy one fourth of the said spoils&mdash;a
      large jolt of <i>aguardiente!</i> You must have it to steady your nerves.
      Go to the nearest <i>cantina</i> and buy one drink; then come back with
      the change. By that time I shall have breakfasted and you and I will then
      go shopping. At noon you shall have another drink; at four o'clock
      another; and just before retiring you shall have the fourth and last for
      this day. Remember, Cafferty: one jolt&mdash;no more&mdash;and then back
      here with the exact change.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      As Don Juan scurried for salvation, Webster turned to Dolores. &ldquo;He'll
      fail me now, but that will not be his fault but mine. I've set him
      too great a task in his present weakened condition. In the process of
      exchanging American gold for the local shin-plasters, he'll skin me
      to death and emerge from the transaction with a full quart bottle in
      excess of his drink. Nevertheless, to use a colloquial expression, I have
      the Cafferty goat&mdash;and I'm going to keep it.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Webster went immediately to his room, called for pen and paper, and
      proceeded at once to do that which he had never done before&mdash;to wit,
      prepare his last will and testament. For the first time in his career
      death threatened while he had money in his possession, and while he had
      before him for performance a task requiring the expenditure of money, his
      manifest duty, therefore, was to guarantee the performance of that task,
      win, lose, or draw in the game of life; so in a few brief paragraphs John
      Stuart Webster made a holographic will and split his bankroll equally
      between the two human beings he cared for most&mdash;Billy Geary and
      Dolores Huey. &ldquo;Bill's a gambler like me,&rdquo; he ruminated;
      &ldquo;so I'll play safe. The girl is a conservative, and after Bill's
      wad is gone, he'd be boiled in oil before he'd prejudice hers.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Having made his will, Webster made a copy of it. The original he placed in
      an envelope, sealed, and marked: &ldquo;Last Will and Testament of John S.
      Webster, of Denver, Colorado, U. S. A. To be delivered to William H. Geary
      upon the death of the testator.&rdquo; The copy he also placed in an
      envelope marked: &ldquo;From Jack. Not to be opened until after my death.&rdquo;
      This envelope he then enclosed in a larger one and mailed to Billy at
      Calle de Concordia No. 19.
    </p>
    <p>
      Having made his few simple preparations for death, Mr. Webster next
      burrowed in his trunk, brought forth his big army-type automatic pistol
      and secured it in a holster under his arm, for he deemed it unwise and
      provocative of curiosity to appear in immaculate ducks that bulged at the
      right hip. Next he filled two spare clips with cartridges and slipped them
      into his pocket, thus completing his few simple preparations for life.
    </p>
    <p>
      He glanced out the window at the sun. There would still be an hour of
      daylight; so he descended to the lobby, called a carriage and drove to the
      residence of the American consulate.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lemuel Tolliver, formerly proprietor of a small retail wood and coal yard
      in Hastings, Nebraska, was the consul. He talked through his nose,
      employed double negatives, chewed tobacco, wore celluloid cuffs and
      collar, and received Mr. Webster in his shirt sleeves. He was the type of
      small-town peanut politician who never forgets for an instant that to be
      an American is greater than to be a king, and who strives assiduously to
      exhibit his horrible idea of American democracy to all and sundry, to his
      own profound satisfaction and the shame of his visiting countrymen.
    </p>
    <p>
      He glanced at the card which Webster had sent in by his clerk. &ldquo;Well,
      sir!&rdquo; he began briskly. &ldquo;Delighted to know you, Mr. Webster.
      Ain't there nothin' I can do for you?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank you. There is. This is my will. Please put it in your safe
      until I or my executor shall call for it.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What!&rdquo; boomed the Honourable Tolliver. &ldquo;You ain't
      thinkin' o' dyin', are yuh?&rdquo; he laughed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Listen,&rdquo; Webster urged him, and Mr. Tolliver helped himself
      to a fresh bite of chewing-tobacco and inclined his head. Briefly, but
      without omitting a single important detail, Webster told the consul of his
      adventure in New Orleans with the secret service representative of the
      Republic of Sobrante. &ldquo;And not an hour since,&rdquo; he concluded,
      &ldquo;I was informed, through a source I consider reliable, that I am in
      momentary danger of assassination at the hands of two men whose names I
      know.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, don't tell me nothin' about it,&rdquo; Mr.
      Tolliver interrupted. &ldquo;I'm here on Government affairs, not to
      straighten out private quarrels. If you're figurin' on gittin'
      killed, my advice to you is to git out o' the country P. D. Q.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You overlook the fact that I didn't come here for advice, my
      dear Mr. Consul,&rdquo; Webster reminded him with some asperity. &ldquo;I'm
      not at all afraid of getting killed. What is worrying me is the certainty
      that I'll get there first with the most guns, and if I should, in
      self-defense, be forced to eliminate two Sobrantean army officers, I want
      to know what you're going to do to protect me. I want to make an
      affidavit that my life is in danger; I want my witness to make a similar
      affidavit, and I want to file those affidavits with you, to be adduced as
      evidence to support my plea of selfdefense. In other words, I want to have
      these affidavits, with the power of the United States back of them, to
      spring in case the Sobrantean government tries to railroad me for murder&mdash;and
      I want you to spring them for me.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I won't do nothin' o' the kind,&rdquo; Mr.
      Tolliver declared bluntly. &ldquo;You got plenty o' chance to get
      out o' this country an' save international complications. <i>La
      Estrellita</i> pulls out to-morrow mornin', an' you pull with
      her, or stay an' take your own chances. I ain't prejudicin'
      my job by makin' myself <i>nux vomica</i> to the Sobrantean
      government&mdash;an' that's just what will happen if I mix up
      in this private quarrel.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But, my dear Mr. Consul, I am going into business here&mdash;the
      mining business. I have every right in this country, and it is your duty
      to protect my rights while here. I can't side-step a fight just to
      hold you in your job.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's a matter outside my jurisdiction,&rdquo; Mr. Tolliver
      declared with such a note of finality in his voice that Webster saw the
      uselessness of further argument.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All right,&rdquo; he replied, holding his temper as best he could.
      &ldquo;I'm glad to know you think so much of your job. I may live
      long enough to find an opportunity to kick you out of it and run this
      consulate myself. I'll send my affidavits direct to the State
      department at Washington; you take orders from Washington, I dare say.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When I get them. Good day.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      John Stuart Webster left the American consulate in a frenzy of
      inarticulate rage in the knowledge that he was an American and represented
      in Sobrante by such an invertebrate as the Honourable Lemuel Tolliver. At
      the Hotel Mateo he dismissed the carriage, climbed the three short steps
      to the entrance and was passing through the revolving portal, when from
      his rear some one gave the door a violent shove, with the result that the
      turnstile partition behind him collided with his back with sufficient
      force to throw him against the partition in front. Instantly the door
      ceased to pivot, with Webster locked neatly in the triangular space
      between the two sections of the revolving door and the jamb.
    </p>
    <p>
      He turned and beheld in the section behind him an officer of the
      Sobrantean army. This individual, observing he was under Webster's
      scrutiny, scowled and peremptorily motioned to Webster to proceed&mdash;which
      the latter did, with such violence that the door, continuing to revolve,
      caught up with the Sobrantean and subjected him to the same indignity to
      which he had subjected Webster.
    </p>
    <p>
      Once free of the door, Webster waited just inside the lobby for the
      Sobrantean to conclude his precipitate entrance. When he did, Webster
      looked him over with mild curiosity and bowed with great condescension.
      &ldquo;Did any gentleman ever tell the senor that he is an ill-mannered
      monkey?&rdquo; he queried coolly in excellent Spanish. &ldquo;If not, I
      desire to give the senor that information, and to tell him that his size
      alone prevents me from giving him a nice little spanking.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pig!&rdquo; the rude one answered hotly. His olive features paled
      with anger, he trembled with emotion and seemed undecided what to do&mdash;seeing
      which Webster grinned at him tantalizingly. That decided him. No
      Latin-American, with the exaggerated ego of his race, can bear even a
      suspicion of ridicule. The officer walked fiercely toward Webster and
      swung his arm toward the latter's face in an effort to land a slap
      that was &ldquo;meant.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Webster merely threw back his head and avoided the blow; his long left arm
      shot out and beat down the Sobrantean's guard; then Webster's
      right hand closed around the officer's collar. &ldquo;Come to me,
      thou insolent little one,&rdquo; he crooned, and jerked his assailant
      toward him, gathered him up in his arms, carried him, kicking and
      screaming with futile rage, out into the <i>patio</i> and soused him in
      the fountain.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, then, spitfire, that will cool your hot head, I trust,&rdquo;
      he admonished his unhappy victim, and returned to the hotel. At the desk
      he paused.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who was that person I just bathed?&rdquo; he inquired of the
      excited clerk.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, senor, you shall not long be kept in ignorance,&rdquo; that
      functionary informed him. &ldquo;That is the terrible Captain Benavides&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you know, I had a notion it was he?&rdquo; Webster replied
      ruminatively. &ldquo;Well, I suppose I'm in for a duel now,&rdquo;
      he added to himself as he climbed the stairs to his room. &ldquo;I think
      that will be most interesting.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      John Stuart Webster changed into dry clothing and descended to the dining
      room. Miss Ruey was already seated at her table and motioned him to the
      seat opposite her, and as he sat down with a contented little sigh, she
      gazed at him with a newer and more alert interest.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hear you've been having adventures again,&rdquo; she
      challenged. &ldquo;The news is all over the hotel. I heard it from the
      head waiter.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Coffee and pistols for two at daylight,&rdquo; he answered
      cheerily. &ldquo;Whenever I see trouble coming and realize that I cannot
      possibly avoid it, I generally take the bull by the horns, so to speak,
      and go forth to meet it. I have discovered from experience that the
      surprise of the attack generally disorganizes the other fellow, for few
      people care to fight an eager enemy. I see you have sampled the soup. Is
      it good?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Excellent. I marvel that your appetite is so keen, considering the
      gloomy outlook.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, there won't be any trouble,&rdquo; he assured her.
      &ldquo;Duelling is silly, and I wouldn't engage in it on a bet. By
      the way, I have made my will, just to be on the safe side. Will you be
      good enough to take charge of it until after the funeral? You can turn it
      over to Billy then.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      She fell readily into the bantering spirit with which he treated this
      serious subject. Indeed, it was quite impossible to do otherwise, for John
      Stuart Webster's personality radiated such a feeling of security, of
      absolute, unbounded confidence in the future and disdain for whatever of
      good fortune or ill the future might entail, that Dolores, found it
      impossible not to assimilate his mood.
    </p>
    <p>
      At seven-thirty, after a delightful dinner, the memory of which Mr.
      Webster was certain would linger under his foretop long after every other
      memory had departed, he escorted her to the open carriage he had ordered,
      and for two hours they circled the Malecon with the élite of Buenaventura,
      listening to the music of the band, and during the brief intermissions, to
      the sound of the waves lapping the beach at the foot of the broad
      driveway.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This,&rdquo; said John Stuart Webster, as he said goodnight to
      Dolores in the lobby, &ldquo;is the end of a perfect day.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      It wasn't, for at that precise moment a servant handed him a card,
      and indicated a young man seated in an adjacent lounging-chair, at the
      same time volunteering the information that the visitor had been awaiting
      Senor Webster's return for the past hour.
    </p>
    <p>
      Webster glanced at the card and strode over to the young man. &ldquo;I am
      Mr. Webster, sir,&rdquo; he announced civilly in Spanish. &ldquo;And you
      are Lieutenant Arredondo?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The visitor rose, bowed low and indicated he was that gentleman. &ldquo;I
      have called, Mr. Webster,&rdquo; he stated in most excellent English,
      &ldquo;in the interest of my friend and comrade, Captain Benavides.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, yes! The fresh little rooster I ducked in the fountain this
      evening. Well, what does the little squirt want now? Another ducking?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Arredondo flushed angrily but remembered the dignity of his mission and
      controlled his temper. &ldquo;Captain Benavides has asked me to express to
      you the hope that you, being doubtless a man of honour&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Stop right there, Lieutenant. There is no doubt about it. I <i>am</i>
      a man of honour, and unless you are anxious to be ducked in the fountain,
      you will be more careful in your choice of words. Now, then: You are about
      to say that, being a man of honour&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You would accord my friend the satisfaction which one gentleman
      never fails to accord another.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That lets me out, <i>amigo</i>.&rdquo; Webster laughed. &ldquo;Benavides
      isn't a gentleman. He's a cutthroat, a murdering little
      black-and-tan hound. Do I understand he wants me to fight a duel with him?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Lieutenant Arredondo could not trust himself to speak, and so he bowed
      profoundly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very well, then, Lieutenant,&rdquo; Webster agreed. &ldquo;I'll
      fight him.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To-morrow morning at five o'clock.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Five minutes from now if you say so.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Captain Benavides will be grateful for your willing spirit, at
      least,&rdquo; the second replied bitterly. &ldquo;You realize, of course,
      Mr. Webster, that as the challenged party, the choice of weapons rests
      with you.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainly. I wouldn't have risked a duel if the choice lay
      with the other fellow. With your permission, my dear sir, we'll
      fight with Mauser rifles at a thousand yards, for the reason that I never
      knew a greaser that could hit the broad side of a brewery at any range
      over two hundred and fifty yards.&rdquo; Webster chuckled fiendishly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lieutenant Arredondo bit his lips in anger and vexation. &ldquo;I cannot
      agree to such an extraordinary duel,&rdquo; he complained. &ldquo;Have you
      no other choice?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, since a fight at long range doesn't suit you, suppose
      we have one at close range. I propose that our seconds handcuff us
      together by our left wrists, give each of us a knife and leave us alone in
      a room for a couple of minutes.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My friend, Captain Benavides, sir, is not a butcher,&rdquo;
      Arredondo reminded Mr. Webster acidly. &ldquo;In such a fight as you
      describe, he would be at a great disadvantage.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You're whistling&mdash;he would. I'd swing him around
      my head with my left hand and dash his fool brains out.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is the custom in Sobrante for gentlemen to fight with rapiers.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, dry up, you sneaking murderer,&rdquo; Webster exploded. &ldquo;There
      isn't going to be any duel except on my terms&mdash;so you might as
      well take a straight tip from headquarters and stick to plain
      assassination. You and Benavides have been sent out by your superior to
      kill me&mdash;you got your orders this very afternoon at the entrance to
      the government palace&mdash;and I'm just not going to be killed. I
      don't like the way you part your hair, and I despise a man who uses
      cologne and wears his handkerchief up his sleeve; so beat it, boy, while
      the going is good.&rdquo; He pointed toward the hotel door. &ldquo;Out,
      you blackguard!&rdquo; he roared. &ldquo;<i>Vaya!</i>&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Lieutenant Arredondo rose and with dignified mien started for the door.
      Webster followed, and as his visitor reached the portal, a tremendous
      kick, well placed, lifted him down to the sidewalk. Shrieking curses, he
      fled into the night; and John Stuart Webster, with a satisfied feeling
      that something accomplished had earned a night's repose, retired to
      his room and his mauve silk pyjamas, and slept the sleep of a healthy,
      conscience-free man. It did occur to him that the morrow would almost
      certainly bring forth something unpleasant, but that prospect did not
      worry him. John Stuart Webster had a religion all his own, and one of the
      principal tenets of this faith of his was an experience-born conviction
      that to-morrow is always another day.
    </p>
    <p>
      At about the same hour Neddy Jerome, playing solitaire in the Engineers'
      Club in Denver, was the recipient of a cablegram which read:
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>If W. cables accepting reply rejecting account job filled otherwise
      beans spilled. Implicit obedience spells victory.</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Henrietta.</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      Neddy Jerome wiped his spectacles, adjusted them on his nose and read this
      amazing message once more. &ldquo;Jumped-up Jehosophat!&rdquo; he
      murmured. &ldquo;If she hasn't followed that madcap Webster clear to
      Buenaventura! If she isn't out in earnest to earn her fee, I'm
      an orang-outang! By thunder, that's a smart woman. Evidently she has
      Jack winging; he is willing to return and go to work for me, but for
      reasons of her own she doesn't want him to win too easy a victory.
      Well, I guess she knows her own game better than I do; so I should worry
      how she plays it. 'Implicit obedience spells victory.' Victory
      means that crazy Webster takes the job I offered him. All right! I'll
      be implicitly obedient.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Two hours later Neddy Jerome received another cablegram. It was from John
      Stuart Webster and read as follows:
    </p>
    <p>
      Hold job ninety days at latest may be back before. If satisfactory cable.
    </p>
    <p>
      Again Mr. Jerome had recourse to the most powerful expletive at his
      command. &ldquo;Henrietta knew he was going to cable and beat the old
      sour-dough to it,&rdquo; he soliloquized. He was wrapped in profound
      admiration of her cunning for as much as five minutes; then he indicted
      this reply to his victim:
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Time, tide and good jobs wait for no man. Sorry. Job already filled by
      better man.</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      When John Stuart Webster received that cablegram the following morning, he
      cursed bitterly&mdash;not because he had lost the best job that had ever
      been offered him, but because he had lost through playing a good hand
      poorly. He hated himself for his idiocy.

      CHAPTER XVIII
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">F</span>OR fully an hour
      after retiring John Stuart Webster slept the deep, untroubled sleep of a
      healthy, unworried man; then one of the many species of &ldquo;jigger&rdquo;
      which flourish just north and south of the equator crawled into bed with
      him and promptly proceeded to establish its commissary on the inner flank
      of the Websterian thigh, where the skin is thin and the blood close to the
      surface. As a consequence, Mr. Webster awoke suddenly, obliterated the
      intruder and got out of bed for the purpose of anointing the injured spot
      with alcohol&mdash;which being done, an active search of the bed resulted
      in the discovery of three more jiggers and the envelopment of John Stuart
      Webster's soul in the fogs of apprehension. Wide awake, he sat on
      the edge of the bed, massaging his toes and wondering what he should do
      about it. From a contemplation of his own case his mind wandered to
      Dolores Ruey. He wondered if the jiggers were picking on her, too&mdash;poor
      girl! Strange that Billy hadn't warned him against these infernal
      insects&mdash;probably it was because Billy resided at El Buen Amigo,
      where, for some mysterious reason, the jigger was not.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Tis an evil land, filled with trouble,&rdquo; he mused as he
      lighted a cigarette. &ldquo;I wish Bill were here to advise me. He's
      been long enough in this country to know the lay of the ground and all the
      government officials. He ought to be able to straighten this deal out and
      assure the higher-ups that I'm not butting in on their political
      affairs. But Bill's up-country and here I am under surveillance and
      unable to leave the hotel to talk it over with Andrew Bowers, the only
      other white expert I know of in town. And by the way, they're after
      Andrew, too! I wonder what for.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He smoked two more cigarettes, the while he pondered the various visible
      aspects of this dark mess in which he found himself floundering. And
      finally he arrived at a decision. He was well assured that his every
      movement was being watched and reported upon; doubtless the fact that he
      had gone to bed at ten o'clock had already been noted! &ldquo;These
      chaps aren't thorough, though,&rdquo; Webster decided. &ldquo;They'll
      see me safely to bed and pick me up again in the morning&mdash;so I'll
      take a chance that the coast is clear, slip out now and talk it over with
      Andrew.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He looked at his watch&mdash;eleven-thirty. Hurriedly he dressed, strapped
      on his automatic pistol, dragged his bed noiselessly to the open window
      and tied to the bed-leg the rope he used to lash his trunk; then he
      lowered himself out the window. The length of rope permitted him to
      descend within a few feet of the ground, and he dropped with a light thud
      on to the soft earth of the <i>patio</i>. The thrifty landlord had already
      turned out all the electric lights, and the <i>patio</i> was dark.
    </p>
    <p>
      Webster made his way to the street unnoticed, circled the block, found a
      policeman seated sound asleep on the curb of the narrow sidewalk, woke him
      up and inquired for the Calle de Concordia; and ten minutes later he
      appeared before the entrance of El Buen Amigo just as Mother Jenks was
      barring it for the night.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am Mr. Webster,&rdquo; he announced, &ldquo;&mdash;Mr. Geary's
      friend from the United States.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Mother Jenks, having heard of him, was of course profoundly flustered to
      meet this toff who so carelessly wired his down-and-out friends <i>pesos
      oro</i> in lots of a thousand. Cordially she invited him within to stow a
      peg of her best, which invitation Mr. Webster promptly accepted.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To your beautiful eyes,&rdquo; Webster toasted her. &ldquo;And now
      would you mind leading me to the quarters of Billy's friend Mr.
      Bowers?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Mother Jenks looked at him sharply. &ldquo;Wot's up, sir?&rdquo; she
      asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Blessed if I know, Mrs. Jenks. I've come to find out.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then you've not come a second too soon, sir. 'E's
      leavin' at daylight. I'd better hannounce you, sir.'E's
      particular wot company 'e receives.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      She shuffled away, to return presently with the news that Mr. Bowers was
      in his room and would be delighted to receive Mr. Webster. Mother Jenks
      led Webster to the door, knocked, announced him and discreetly withdrew.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear Webster!&rdquo; cried Andrew Bowers enthusiastically, and
      he drew his late fellow-passenger into the room. Webster observed that
      Andrew was not alone. &ldquo;I want to see you privately,&rdquo; he said.
      &ldquo;Didn't know you had company, or I wouldn't have
      intruded.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I knew I had company, didn't I? Come in, you crazy
      fellow, and meet some good friends of mine who are very anxious to meet
      you,&rdquo; He turned to a tall, handsome, scholarly looking man of about
      forty, whose features, dress, and manner of wearing his whiskers
      proclaimed him a personage. &ldquo;Dr. Eliseo Pacheco, I have the honour
      to present Mr. John S. Webster, the American gentleman of whom you have
      heard me speak.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Doctor Pacheco promptly leaped to his feet and bowed with ostentatious
      reverence; then suddenly, with Latin impulsiveness, he advanced upon
      Webster, swept aside the latter's outstretched hand, clasped John
      Stuart Webster in fraternal embrace, and to the old sour-dough's
      inexpressible horror, kissed him upon the right cheek&mdash;after which he
      backed off, bowed once more, and said in Spanish:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sir, my life is yours.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is well he gave it to you before you took it,&rdquo; Andrew said
      in English, and he laughed, noting Webster's confusion. &ldquo;And
      this gentleman is Colonel Pablo Caraveo.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thunder, I'm in for it again,&rdquo; Webster thought&mdash;and
      he was, for the amiable colonel embraced Webster and kissed his left cheek
      before turning to Andrew.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You will convey to our guest, in English, Don Ricardo, assurances
      of my profound happiness in meeting him,&rdquo; he said in Spanish.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Colonel says you're all to the mustard,&rdquo; Andrew at
      once interpreted merrily.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Rather a liberal translation,&rdquo; Webster retorted in Spanish,
      whereat Colonel Caraveo sprang up and clapped his hands in delight.
      Evidently he had looked forward with considerable interest to meeting
      Webster and had had his contentment clouded by the thought that Andrew's
      gringo friend could not speak Spanish.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your happiness, my dear Colonel,&rdquo; Webster continued, &ldquo;is
      extravagant grief compared with my delight in meeting a Sobrantean
      gentleman who has no desire to skewer me.&rdquo; He turned to Andrew.
      &ldquo;While introductions are in order, old son, suppose you complete the
      job and introduce yourself. I'm always suspicious of a man with an
      alias.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then behold the death of that impudent fellow Andrew Bowers, late
      <i>valet de chambre</i> to this eminent mining engineer and prince of
      gentlemen, Mr. John Stuart Webster. Doctor Pacheco, will you be good
      enough to perform the operation?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This gentleman,&rdquo; said the doctor, laying his hand on Andrew's
      shoulder, &ldquo;is Don Ricardo Luiz Ruey, a gentleman, a patriot, and the
      future president of our unhappy country.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Webster put his hands on the young man's shoulders. &ldquo;Ricardo
      my son,&rdquo; he asked earnestly, &ldquo;do you think you could give me
      some little hint of the approximate date on which you will assume office?
      By the nine gods of war, I never wanted a friend at court so badly as I
      want one to-night.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Doctor Pacheco, Colonel Caraveo, and Ricardo Ruey exchanged glances and
      laughed heartily. &ldquo;I must introduce him to Captain Benavides and
      Lieutenant Arredondo,&rdquo; the Colonel said slyly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What!&rdquo; Webster was amazed. &ldquo;You know about it already?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Better than that, friend Webster. We knew about it before it
      happened. That is, we knew it was going to happen,&rdquo; Ricardo informed
      him. .
    </p>
    <p>
      Webster sat down and helped himself from a box of cigars he found on
      Ricardo's bureau. &ldquo;I feel I am among friends at last,&rdquo;
      he announced between preliminary puffs; &ldquo;so listen while I spin a
      strange tale. I've been the picture of bad luck ever since I started
      for this infernal&mdash;this wonderful country of yours. After leaving
      Denver for New Orleans, I came within a whisker of dying of ptomaine
      poisoning. Then in New Orleans I took a Sunday-morning stroll in Jackson
      Square and came across two men trying to knife another. In the interest of
      common decency I interfered and won a sweeping victory, but to my
      amazement the prospective corpse took to his heels and advised me to do
      the same.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Ricardo Ruey sprang for John Stuart Webster. &ldquo;By George,&rdquo; he
      said in English, &ldquo;I'm going to hug you, too. I really ought to
      kiss you, because I'm that man you saved from assassination, but&mdash;too
      long in the U.S.A., I suppose; I've lost the customs of my country.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Get out,&rdquo; yelled Webster, fending him off. &ldquo;Did you
      lose anything in that fracas?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, a Malacca stick.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have it.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Holy Moses! Jack&mdash;I'm going to call you Jack&mdash;why
      didn't you say something about this while we were on the steamer
      together?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, we played crib' and dominoes most of the way down, when
      I wasn't seasick, and we talked about other things. By the way,
      Ricardo&mdash;I'm going to call you Rick for short&mdash;do you
      happen to have any relatives in this country?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, a number of second and third cousins. One lot bears the same
      family name.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No relatives in the United States?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Coming down on the steamer, I didn't like to appear curious,
      but all the time I wanted to ask you one question.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ask it now.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you a Sobrantean?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was born in this country and raised here until I was fourteen.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you're&mdash;why, hang it, you're not a Latin?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, I'm a mixture, with Latin predominating. My forbears were
      pure Castilians from Madrid, and crossed the Western Ocean in caravels. It's
      been a matter of pride with the house of Ruey to keep the breed pure, but
      despite all precautions, the family tree has been grafted once with a
      Scotch thistle, twice with the lily of France, and once with the shamrock
      of Ireland. My mother was an Irishwoman.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You alibi yourself perfectly, Ricardo, and my curiosity is
      appeased. Permit me to continue my tale,&rdquo; he added in Spanish; and
      forthwith he related with humorous detail his adventure at the gangplank
      of the steamer that had borne him and Ricardo Ruey south. Ricardo
      interrupted him. &ldquo;We know all about that, friend Webster, and we
      knew the two delightful gentlemen had been told off to get you&mdash;unofficially.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How did you find out?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A leak in the Intelligence Bureau, of which our friend Colonel
      Caraveo is an assistant chief.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Explain,&rdquo; Webster demanded peremptorily. &ldquo;Why all this
      intrigue extending to two countries and private individuals?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainly. The Sobrantean revolutionary junta has headquarters in
      New Orleans. It is composed of political exiles, for Sarros, the present
      dictator of Sobrante, rules with an iron hand, and has a cute little habit
      of railroading his enemies to the cemetery via the treason charge and the
      firing-squad. Quite a quaint fellow, Sarros! Robs the proletariat and
      spends it on the army with a lavish hand, and so in sheer gratitude they
      keep him in office. Besides, it's a sign of bad luck to oppose him
      at the regular elections. Well, he&mdash;he killed my father, who was the
      best president this benighted country ever had, and I consider it my
      Christian duty to avenge my father and a patriotic duty to take up the
      task he left unfinished&mdash;the task of making over my country.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In Sobrante, as in most of the countries in Central America, there
      are two distinct classes of people&mdash;the aristocrats and peons&mdash;and
      the aristocrat fattens on the peon, as he has had a habit of doing since
      Adam. We haven't any middle class to stand as a buffer between the
      two&mdash;which makes it a sad proposition. My father was an idealist and
      a dreamer and he dreamed of reform in government and a solution of the
      agrarian problem which confronts all Latin-America. Moreover, he trusted
      the common people&mdash;and one should not trust this generation of peons.
      We must have fifty years of education&mdash;free and compulsory&mdash;first.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My father headed a revolution that was brief and practically
      bloodless, and the better to do the task he had set himself, he created a
      dictatorship with himself as dictator&mdash;this because he was shy on
      good cabinet and legislative material, the kind he could trust to play
      fair with the people.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Ricardo paused. &ldquo;You are interested in all this, my friend?&rdquo;
      he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It has an old, familiar sound, but crack along.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My father, being human, erred. He trusted one Pablo Sarros, an
      educated peon, who had commanded the government forces under the regime my
      father overthrew. My tender-hearted parent discovered that Sarros was
      plotting to overthrow him; but instead of having him shot, he merely
      removed him from command. Sarros gathered a handful of bandits, joined
      with the old government forces my father had conquered, hired a couple
      dozen Yankee artillerymen and&mdash;he won out. My father was captured and
      executed; the palace was burned, and my sister perished in the flames. I'm
      here to pay off the score.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A worthy ambition! So you organized the revolutionary junta in New
      Orleans, eh?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Ricardo nodded. &ldquo;Word of it reached Sarros, and he sent his brother
      Raoul, chief of the Intelligence Bureau, to investigate and report. As
      fast as he reported, Colonel Caraveo reported to me. Sarros and his gang
      are just a little bit afraid of me, because he's about as popular
      with the people as a typhus epidemic, and strange to say, this curiously
      mercurial people have not forgotten the brief reign of his predecessor. My
      father's son possesses a name to conjure with. Consequently it was
      to the interest of the Sarros administration that I be eliminated. They
      watched every boat; hence my scheme for eluding their vigilance&mdash;which,
      thanks to you, worked like a charm.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But,&rdquo; Webster complained, &ldquo;I'm not sitting in the
      game at all, and yet I'm caught between the upper and nether
      millstones.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is easy to explain. You interfered that morning in Jackson
      Square; then Raoul Sarros met you going aboard the steamer for
      Buenaventura and you manhandled him; and naturally, putting two and two
      together, he has concluded that you are not only his personal enemy but
      also a friend and protector of mine and consequently an enemy of the
      state.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And as a consequence I'm marked for slaughter?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The first plan considered,&rdquo; said Colonel Càraveo, gravely,
      &ldquo;was for Captain Benavides, who is an expert swordsman and a
      marvellous pistol-shot, to pick a quarrel with you.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No hope, Colonel. I manhandled 'em both and declined to fight
      on their terms. I suppose now I'll just naturally be assassinated.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It would be well, my friend,&rdquo; Doctor Pacheco suggested,
      &ldquo;to return to the United States until after Ricardo and his friends
      have eliminated your Nemesis.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How soon will that happy event transpire?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In about sixty days we hope to be ready to strike, Mr. Webster.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We are recruiting our men secretly,&rdquo; Ricardo explained.
      &ldquo;Our base is back in the hills beyond San Miguel de Padua. I'm
      going up there to-morrow.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was going up to San Miguel de Padua in a day or two myself, Rick,
      but I'll be hanged if I know what to do now. I'm beginning to
      worry&mdash;and that's a new experience with me.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Colonel Caraveo cleared his throat. &ldquo;I understand from Ricardo that
      you and another American are interested in a mining concession, Mr.
      Webster.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Webster nodded.
    </p>
    <p>
      Al-*~
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is this a private landholder, or did your friend secure it from the
      Sarros government?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;From the government. We pay ten per cent, royalty, on a
      ninety-nine-year lease, and that's all I know about it. I have never
      seen the property, and my object in coming was to examine it and, if
      satisfied, finance the project.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you will return to your hotel, my dear sir,&rdquo; Colonel
      Caraveo suggested, &ldquo;and remain there until noon to-morrow, I feel
      confident I can guarantee you immunity from attack thereafter. I have a
      plan to influence my associates in the Intelligence Office.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bully for you, Colonel. Give me sixty days in which to operate, and
      I'll have finished my job in Sobrante and gotten out of it before
      that gang of cutthroats wakes up to the fact that I'm gone. I thank
      you, sir.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The least we can do, since you have saved Ricardo's life and
      rendered our cause a great service, is to save your life,&rdquo; Colonel
      Caraveo replied.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This is more comfort than I had hoped for when I came here,
      gentlemen. I am very grateful, I assure you. Of course this little
      revolution you're cooking up is no affair of mine, and I trust I
      need not assure you that your confidence is quite safe with me.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The Doctor and the Colonel immediately rose and bowed like a pair of
      marionettes. Webster turned to Ricardo.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have you had any experience in revolutions, my son?&rdquo; he
      asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ricardo nodded. &ldquo;I realized I had to have experience, and so I went
      to Mexico. I was with Madero through the first revolution.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How are you arming your men?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mannlichers. I've got five thousand of them. Cost me twelve
      dollars each. I've got twenty million rounds of cartridges,
      twenty-five machine-guns, and a dozen three-inch field-guns. I have also
      engaged two hundred American ex-soldiers to handle the machine-guns and
      the battery. These rascals cost me five dollars a day gold, but they're
      worth it; they like fighting and will go anywhere to get it&mdash;and are
      faithful.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are secretly mobilizing in the mountains, eh?&rdquo; Webster
      rubbed his chin ruminatively. &ldquo;Then I take it you'll attack
      Buenaventura when you strike the first blow?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Quite right. We must capture a seaport if we are to revolute
      successfully.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm glad to know that. I'll make it my business to be
      up in the mountains at the time. I'm for peace, every rattle out of
      the box. Gentlemen, you've cheered me wonderfully. I will now go
      home and leave you to your evil machinations; and, the good Lord and the
      jiggers willing, I shall yet glean a night's sleep.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He shook hands all around and took his departure. Mother Jenks was waiting
      for Webster at the foot of the stairs. He paused on the threshold.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mrs. Jenks,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;Billy tells me you have been
      very kind to him. I want to tell you how much I appreciate it and that I
      stand willing to reciprocate any time you are in need.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Mother Jenks fingered her beard and reflected. &ldquo;'Ave you met
      Miss Dolores Ruey, sir?&rdquo; she queried.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your ward? Yes.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Ow does the lamb strike you, Mr. Webster?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have never met many women; I have known few intimately; but I
      should say that Miss Dolores Ruey is the marvel of her sex. She is as
      beautiful as she is good, as good as she is intelligent, and as
      intelligent as she can be.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She's a lydy, sir,&rdquo; Mother Jenks affirmed proudly.
      &ldquo;An' I done it. You can see with arf a heye wot I am, but for
      all that, I've done my dooty by her. From the day my sainted 'Enery&mdash;
      'e was a colonel o' hartillery under President Ruey, Dolores's
      father&mdash;hescaped from the burnin' palace with 'er an'
      told me to raise 'er a lydy for the syke of her father, as was the
      finest gentleman this rotten country 'll ever see, she's been
      my guidin' star. She's self-supportin' now, but still I
      ain't done my whole dooty by her. I want to see 'er married to
      a gentleman as 'll maintain 'er like a lydy.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, Mrs. Jenks, I think you will live to see that worthy
      ambition, attained. Mr. Geary is head over heels in love with her.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Aye. Willie's a nice lad&mdash;I could wish no better; but
      wot 'e's got 'e got from you, an' where'll
      'e be if 'is mine doesn't p'y big? Now, with you,
      sir, it's different. You're a bit oldern' Billy, an'
      more settled an' serious; you've made yer fortune, so Willie
      tells me, an', not to go beatin' about the bally bush, I s'y,
      wot's the matter with you an' her steppin' over the
      broomstick together? You might go a bloomin' sight farther an'
      fare wuss.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Too old, my dear schemer, too old!&rdquo; John Stuart replied
      smilingly. &ldquo;And she's in love with Billy. Don't worry.
      If he doesn't make a go of this mining concession, I'll take
      care of his finances until he can do so himself. I do not mind telling
      you, in strictest confidence, that I have made my will and divided my
      money equally between them.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Gord bless you, for a sweet, kind gentleman,&rdquo; Mother Jenks
      gulped, quite overcome with emotion.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hastily Webster bade Mother Jenks good-night and hurried away to escape a
      discussion on such a delicate topic with Billy's blunt and
      single-minded landlady. His mind was in a tumult. So it was that he paid
      no attention to a vehicle that jogged by him with the <i>cochero</i>
      sagging low in his seat, half asleep over the reins, until a quick command
      from the closed interior brought the vehicle to an abrupt halt, half a
      block in advance of Webster.
    </p>
    <p>
      Save for an arc-light at each end of the block, the Calle de Concordia was
      dim; save for Webster, the carriage and the two men who piled hurriedly
      out at the rear of the conveyance, the Calle de Concordia was devoid of
      life. Webster saw one of the men hurriedly toss a coin to the <i>cochero</i>;
      with a fervent &ldquo;<i>Gracias, mi capitan</i>,&rdquo; the driver
      clucked to his horse, turned the corner into the Calle Elizondo and
      disappeared, leaving his late passengers facing Webster and calmly
      awaiting his approach. He was within twenty feet of them when the taller
      of the two men spoke.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good evening, my American friend. This meeting is a pleasure we
      scarcely hoped to have so soon. For the same we are indebted to Lieutenant
      Arredondo, who happened to look back as we passed you, and recognized you
      under the arc-light.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Webster halted abruptly; the two Sobrantean officers stood smiling and
      evidently enjoying his discomfort. Each carried a service revolver in a
      closed holster fastened to his sword-belt, but neither had as yet made a
      move to draw&mdash;seeing which, Webster felt sufficiently reassured to
      accept the unwelcome situation with a grace equal to that of his enemies.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What? You two bad little boys up this late! I'm surprised,&rdquo;
      he replied in Spanish. He folded his arms, struck an attitude and surveyed
      them as might an indignant father. &ldquo;You kids have been up to some
      mischief,&rdquo; he added, as his right hand closed over the butt of his
      automatic, where it lay snuggled in the open bolster under his left arm
      between his shirt and coat. &ldquo;Can it be possible you are going to
      take advantage of superior numbers and the fact that you are both armed,
      to force me into a duel on your terms, my dear Captain Benavides?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      By a deferential bow, the unwholesome Benavides indicated that such were
      his intentions. &ldquo;Then,&rdquo; said Webster, &ldquo;as the challenged
      party I have the choice of weapons. I choose pistols.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;At what range?&rdquo; the Lieutenant asked with mock interest.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As we stand at present. I'm armed. Pull your hardware, you
      pretty pair of polecats, and see if you can beat me to the draw.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Captain Benavides's jaw dropped slightly; with a quiet, deliberate
      motion his hand stole to his holster-flap. Lieutenant Arredondo wet his
      lips and glanced so apprehensively at his companion that Webster was aware
      that here was a situation not to his liking.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You should use an open holster,&rdquo; Webster taunted. &ldquo;Come,
      come&mdash;unbutton that holster-flap and get busy.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Benavides's hand came away from the holster. He was not the least
      bit frightened, but his sense of proportion in matters of this kind was
      undergoing a shake-up.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In disposing of any enemy in a gun fight, so a professional killer
      once informed me,&rdquo; Webster continued, &ldquo;it is a good plan to
      put your first bullet anywhere in the abdomen; the shock of a bullet there
      paralyzes your opponent for a few seconds and prevents him from returning
      the compliment, and in the interim you blow his brains out while he lies
      looking at you. I have never had any practical experience in matters of
      this kind, but I don't mind telling you that if I <i>must</i>
      practise on somebody, the good Lord could not have provided two more
      delightful subjects.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He ceased speaking, and for nearly half a minute the three men appraised
      each other. Benavides was smiling slightly; Arredondo was fidgeting;
      Webster's glance never faltered from the Captain's nervous
      hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You would be very foolish to draw,&rdquo; Webster then assured
      Benavides. &ldquo;If I am forced to kill you, it will be with profound
      regret. Suppose you two dear, sweet children run along home and think this
      thing over. You may change your mind by to-morrow morn&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The Captain's hand, with the speed of a juggler's, had flown
      to his holster; but quick as he was, Webster was a split-second quicker.
      The sound of his shot roared through the silent <i>calle</i>, and
      Benavides, with his pistol half drawn, lifted a bloody, shattered hand
      from the butt as Webster's automatic swept in a swift arc and
      covered Arredondo, whose arms on the instant went skyward.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That wasn't a half-bad duel,&rdquo; Webster remarked coldly.
      &ldquo;Are you not obliged to me, Captain, for not blowing your brains out&mdash;for
      disregarding my finer instincts and refraining from shooting you first
      through the abdomen? Bless you, my boy, I've been stuck for years in
      places where the only sport consisted in seeing who could take a revolver,
      shoot at a tin can and roll it farthest in three seconds. Let me see your
      hand.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Benavides sullenly held up that dripping member, and Webster inspected it
      at a respectful distance. &ldquo;Steel-jacket bullet,&rdquo; he informed
      the wounded man. &ldquo;Small hole&mdash;didn't do much damage. You'll
      be just as well as ever in a month.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He helped himself to Arredondo's gun, flipped out the cylinder, and
      slipped all six cartridges into his palm. Similarly he disarmed Benavides,
      expressed his regret that circumstances had rendered it imperative to use
      force, and strolled blithely down the <i>calle</i>. In the darkened <i>patio</i>
      he groped along the wall until he found the swinging rope by which he had
      descended from his room&mdash;whereupon he removed his shoes, tied the
      laces together, slung them around his neck, dug his toes into the adobe
      wall and climbed briskly to his room.

      Webster waited until Dolores appeared and then accompanied her into the
      dining room for breakfast.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, how did you pass your first night in Buenaventura?&rdquo; she
      inquired, in the manufacture of breakfast conversation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not very well. Jiggers bit me and woke me up, and finally I fell
      into a trance and had a vision&mdash;about you. After that I couldn't
      get to sleep again. I was fairly bursting to see you at breakfast and read
      your palm. I've just discovered a wonderful system.&rdquo;
    </p>

      &ldquo;Show me,&rdquo; she flashed back at him, and she extended her
      little hand. He picked it up gravely and with the dull tine of a fork made
      a great show of tracing the lines on her palm.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are about twenty-four years old, and your ancestors were
      pure-bred Castilians who came from Madrid, crossing the Atlantic in
      caravels. Ever since the first Ruey landed on this coast the family has
      been identified with the government of the country in one way or another.
      Also, Scotch, French, and Irish blood has been infused into the tribe;
      your mother was an Irish woman. When you were quite a little girl, your
      father, Don Ricardo Ruey, at that time president of Sobrante, failed to
      suppress a revolution and was cornered in the government palace, which was
      set afire.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Through the bravery and devotion of a cockney gentleman, Colonel
      Henry Jenks, an artillery officer in your father's army, you were
      saved from perishing in the burning palace. Colonel Jenks turned you over
      to his spouse, now known as Mother Jenks, with instructions to raise you a
      lydy, and Mother Jenks has carried out those instructions. Colonel Jenks
      and your father were executed, and Mother Jenks sent you to the United
      States to be educated. You had a brother, Ricardo Luis Ruey, older than
      yourself by seven or eight years, I should judge. In some mysterious
      manner you and your brother lost track of each other, and at the present
      moment he believes you perished in the flames that gutted the government
      palace.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are of a proud, independent nature; you work at something for a
      living, and inasmuch as you haven't been able to set aside a great
      deal of money from your earnings, you are planning to terminate your visit
      to your native land at an early date and return to the United States for
      the purpose of getting back to work. These plans, however, will never be
      consummated.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why? Because you are to be married to a nice man and live happily
      ever afterward; and about sixty days from now, if all goes well, I, John
      S. Webster, am going to introduce you to your long-lost brother Ricarda
      You will first see Ricardo riding at the head of his victorious rebel
      troops as he enters Buenaventura. He will be the next president of this
      wretched country, if, fortunately, he is not killed in the revolution he
      is now fomenting against his father's ancient enemy. Your brother
      does not know you are living, and it will be a proud and happy day for me
      when I bring him to you. In the interim, what do you purpose having for
      breakfast? Ham and eggs sunny side up, an omelette or a cereal?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He released her hand and favoured her with the boyish grin that always had
      the effect of stripping the years from him as one strips the husk from a
      ripe ear of com. She was gazing at him in wide-eyed amazement.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, don't doubt me,&rdquo; he pleaded. &ldquo;It will all
      come out just as I have told you. Of course, I don't go in for
      telling fortunes very often; I'm a slow old horse to start, but once
      I sneak into the collar, something has to give.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is my brother really alive?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He was as late as midnight last night. Do you recall the chap I
      saved from being assassinated in New Orleans?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your worthy brother. And do you recall the chauffeur whose passage
      to this port I was forced to pay?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The same individual. I sent him ashore in the launch with Billy,
      and he has been housed at El Buen Amigo, but left early this morning for
      the back-country to open a recruiting office.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you have known this all along and wouldn't tell me?&rdquo;
      she reproved him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Didn't discover it until after I had left him last night;
      then I put two and two together and made four.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I can hardly believe it.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I never lie.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Never?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I mean on serious matters. And you needn't cry about it, Miss
      Ruey. I do not purpose being the bearer of welcome news and having my
      breakfast ruined for my reward.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      She reached across the little table and squeezed his big brown hand
      impulsively. &ldquo;You're the most wonderful man I ever knew. And
      does my poor brother know I am living, Mr. Webster?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No&mdash;and I'm not going to tell him. I think it will be
      much nicer to restore you to each other on the steps of the government
      palace on the day when the Ruey faction comes into its own again. That
      will make his victory all the sweeter. I am the innocent bystander who
      started this little drama, and by jingo, I want to finish it. Why, it has
      been years and years since I've had any real sport.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You're so kind!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not at all. My discovery of your brother was as accidental as
      falling downstairs.&rdquo; And he related to her his interview with
      Ricardo, whose statements, when compared with the information gleaned from
      Mother Jenks, had proved so illuminating. &ldquo;By the way,&rdquo; he
      continued, &ldquo;where was Ricardo when your father's ship of state
      went on the rocks?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;At school in a military academy in Kentucky. At least, so I was
      informed by my cousins here shortly after my arrival, and prior to losing
      caste with them because of my association, unchaperoned, with Billy.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is a marvellous mix-up, which Ricardo can doubtless explain,
      Miss Ruey. I know he believes his sister perished with her father; Mother
      Jenks didn't know where he was and couldn't communicate with
      him&mdash;and there you are. However, little old Jack Fix-it will bring
      you together again in due course. In the interim, how about those eggs?
      Straight up&mdash;or flip 'em?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      She beamed across at him. &ldquo;We are going to be such good, true
      friends, aren't we?&rdquo; she urged. He almost shivered, but
      managed a hypocritical nod. &ldquo;While we have only known each other
      twenty-four hours, it seems a great deal longer than that&mdash;probably
      because Billy has told me so much about you, and you're&mdash;so
      comfortable and easy to get acquainted with, and I&mdash;I can't
      very well express my gratitude for what you've done&mdash;for what
      you're going to do.&rdquo; Her voice faltered; she smiled roguishly
      through the tears of her emotion. &ldquo;If I were only Billy, now, I
      could put my arm across your shoulders and settle the matter by saying:
      'Johnny, you old horsethief, you're all right.'&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The best thing to do would be to cease puffing me up with
      importance. And now, before we climb out of the realm of romance and the
      improbable to the more substantial plane of things for breakfast, just one
      brief word of caution. Now that I have told you your brother lives and is
      in Buenaventura, forget it until I mention it again, because his presence
      here is his secret, not ours.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All right, Caliph,&rdquo; she agreed. &ldquo;I think I shall call
      you that hereafter. Like the late Caliph Haroun A! Raschid, it appears you
      have a habit of prowling around o' nights in queer places, doing
      good deeds for your subjects. But tell me about my brother. Describe him
      to me.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not now. Here comes the head waiter with a cablegram for me, I
      think.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      That functionary came to their table and handed one of the familiar yellow
      envelopes to each of them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We'll excuse each other,&rdquo; Dolores suggested. She read:
    </p>
    <p>
      Go you if I lose. I like you fine.
    </p>
    <p>
      You are a good, game little scout, and Jerome.
    </p>
    <p>
      She glanced across at Webster, whose face was a conflicting study of
      emotions in which disappointment and amazement appeared to predominate.
      &ldquo;You ancient scoundrel,&rdquo; she heard him murmur.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What ho, Caliph! Unpleasant news?&rdquo; she ventured.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes&mdash;and no. I had one of the finest jobs in the world all
      staked out&mdash;and now the boss cables me it's filled&mdash;by a
      better man.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What are you going to do about it?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well&mdash;as soon as I've had my breakfast, I'm going
      to cable Neddy Jerome and tell him I'm satisfied&mdash;satisfied to
      stay here and satisfied he's a liar. You see, Miss Ruey, he objected
      vigorously to my coming here in the first place&mdash;wanted me to take a
      thirty-day vacation and then manage the Colorado Consolidated Mines
      Company, Limited, for him. I like Neddy and would have been glad to go to
      work for his company, but of course Billy comes first, and so I declined
      the offer. Later I changed my mind, and last night I cabled him I'd
      accept if he'd wait sixty days&mdash;possibly ninety; and now he
      replies that he's sorry, but the job is filled by a better man. That's
      why I know he's a liar.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I see. You figure there isn't a better mining engineer than
      you&mdash;eh, Caliph?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He looked at her reproachfully. &ldquo;No, but Neddy Jerome does, and I
      know he does because he has taken the trouble to tell me so more than
      once. And as a rule Neddy inclines toward the truth. However, it's
      just as well&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; He paused, staring hard at her. &ldquo;By
      the way, you foretold this! Why, this is amazing.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      She could now have wept with laughter. &ldquo;Well&rdquo;&mdash;soberly&mdash;&ldquo;I
      told you some other things equally amazing, did I not?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, you told me other things more or less interesting, but you <i>fore</i>told
      this. How do you account for that?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The witness declines to answer, on the ground that she may
      incriminate herself and be burned for a witch.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Remarkable woman!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You were about to remark that it is just as well&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That Neddy's reconciled to losing me, because since cabling
      him yesterday evening I've changed my mind again. I'm going to
      stay here now.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Indeed! Why?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Just to be obstinate. Apparently I'm not wanted here by the
      powers that be; so just to rile them I'm going to hang around
      Sobrante the way Grant hung around Richmond and argue the question with
      them. By the way, I see you received a cablegram also. Better news than
      mine, I hope.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      She nodded. &ldquo;I have a little business deal on back home. Haven't
      got a great deal invested, but it looks as if I might make ten thousand
      dollars.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He arched his eyebrows and favoured her with a little disapproving grunt.
      Sounded like the prospectus of a fake mining promoter&mdash;yes, by
      thunder, that was it. Dolores was a school teacher, and school teachers
      and doctors are ever the mainstay of a swindler's sucker list.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You won ten dollars from me yesterday,&rdquo; he challenged.
      &ldquo;Bet you another ten I can tell you the nature of your investment.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Go you, if I lose!&rdquo; Unconsciously she was learning the argot
      of the male of the species, as exemplified in Neddy Jerome's
      cablegram.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's a mining property.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You win. It is,&rdquo; she answered truthfully, starting to open
      her purse.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Quartz or placer?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't know. Explain.&rdquo; *
    </p>
    <p>
      He chuckled at her ignorance. &ldquo;Quartz is goldbearing rock, and
      placer is gold-bearing gravel.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then my mining property is placer, because it has lots of sand.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I knew it, I knew it,&rdquo; he warned her solemnly, and he shook
      an admonitory finger at her. &ldquo;Black sand, eh? Is the gold very fine?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think it is.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then you're stung good and deep&mdash;so don't delude
      yourself into thinking you have ten thousand dollars coming. I never knew
      a proposition for saving the fine gold in black sand that didn't
      turn out to be a fizzle. It's the hardest thing in the world to
      save. Now, listen: You tell me the name of the flim-flam artist that got
      you into this deal, and when I get back to the United States I'll
      investigate the company; if it's an out-and-out swindle, I'll
      take that promoter by the throat and choke your money out of him, the
      scoundrel! It is just these fly-by-night fellows that ruin the finest
      gambling game in the world and scare off investors in legitimate mining
      propositions.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, you mustn't&mdash;really, Caliph. He's an old man,
      and I only did it to help him out.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There should be no sentiment in business, Miss Ruey.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, well, let's be cheerful and hopeful, Caliph, and discuss
      a more important subject.&rdquo; She was very serious now, for by her
      meddling she had, she realized, so arranged matters that at a time when
      John Stuart Webster's very life depended upon his immediate
      departure from Buenaventura, he was planning to stay and face the music,
      just to be obstinate. &ldquo;You must reconsider your latest decision to
      remain in this country,&rdquo; she insisted. &ldquo;Your life may be the
      price of liberty of action, you know.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Give me liberty or give me death,'&rdquo; quoted
      Webster.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But isn't Billy capable of developing the mine after you
      advance the cash?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wouldn't advance him a cent for his mine until I had
      investigated it myself.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then you should make some arrangements to safeguard yourself while
      making the investigation, and leave Sobrante immediately thereafter. Isn't
      that a sensible proposition?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very&mdash;if I felt like leaving Sobrante. But I do not. If that
      mining concession is a potential winner, I'll have to stick around
      and make a winner out of it before I go away and leave Bill in charge.
      Besides, I'm worried about Bill. He's full of malarial fever,
      and last night I got thinking about him and decided to send him back to
      the Colorado mountains for a few months. This country is going to be in
      the throes of a revolution; the chances are we will not be able to do much
      with our property until the war is over, and I will be able to do that
      little. I want some regular doctors to work on Bill so he'll be fit
      when he gets back on the job.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      As a matter of fact, this idea of sending Billy to the United States had
      but that moment occurred to Jack Webster; he reflected now that this plan
      was little short of an inspiration. It would give Billy and Dolores an
      opportunity to marry and have a honeymoon; it would leave him free of her
      disturbing presence, and enable him to leave Sobrante when the Gearys
      should return. He resolved to speak to Billy about it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dolores's voice broke in upon his cunning reflections. &ldquo;But
      Billy tells me you already have a fortune sufficient for the needs of a
      caliph without a court. Why risk your precious life to acquire more? Money
      isn't everything in life.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, but the game is.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What game? Mining?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The game of life.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But this is the game of death.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Which makes life all the sweeter if I can beat the game. Perhaps I
      can better illustrate my point of view with a story. Some years ago I was
      sent to Arizona to examine a mining property and report upon it; if I
      advised its purchase, my principals were prepared to buy at my valuation.
      Well, when I arrived, I found a miserable shanty close to a shaft and
      dump, and in the shanty I found a weatherbeaten couple. The woman was
      probably forty but looked fifty. The man had never been anything but a
      hard-rock miner&mdash;four dollars a day had been the limit of his
      earnings in any one day until he stumbled on some float, traced it up, and
      located the claims I was there to examine and try to buy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;His wife had been a miner's daughter, knowing nothing but
      drudgery and poverty and continuing that existence after marriage. For
      twenty years she had been darning her husband's socks, washing his
      clothes, and cooking his meals. Even after they uncovered the ledge, it
      wasn't worth any more than the country rock to them unless they
      could sell it, because the man had neither the money nor the ability to
      develop it himself. He even lacked the ability to sell it, because it
      requires real ability to unload any kind of a mine for a million dollars,
      and real nerve on the part of the man who buys. I examined the mine,
      decided it was cheap at a million dollars, and so reported to my
      principals. They wired me to close, and so I took a sixty-day option in
      order to verify the title.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, time passed, and one bright day I rode up to that shanty with
      a deed and a certified check for a million dollars in my pocket; whereupon
      I discovered the woman had had a change of heart and bucked over the
      traces. No, siree! She would not sign that there deed&mdash;and inasmuch
      as the claim was community property, her signature was vitally necessary.
      She asked me so many questions, however, as to the size of the stamp mill
      we would install and how many miners would be employed on the job, that
      finally I saw the light and tried a shot in the dark. 'My dear Mrs.
      Skaggs,' I said, 'if you'll sign this deed and save us
      all a lot of litigation over this option you and your husband have given
      me, I'll do something handsome. I will&mdash;on my word of honour&mdash;I'll
      give you the exclusive boarding-house privilege at this mine.'&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And what did she say, Caliph?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She said: 'Give me the pen, Mr. Webster, and please excuse my
      handwriting; I'm that nervous in business matters.'&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Dolores's silvery laughter rippled through the room. &ldquo;But I
      don't see the point,&rdquo; she protested.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We will come to it presently. I was merely explaining one person's
      point of view. You would not, of course, expect me to have the same point
      of view as Mrs. Skaggs, of Arizona.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainly not.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All right! Listen to this! In 1907, at the height of the boom times
      in Goldfield, Nevada, I was worth a million dollars. On the first day of
      October I could have cashed in my mining stocks for a million&mdash;and I
      had a lot of cash in bank, too. But I'd always worked so hard and
      been poor so long that my wealth didn't mean anything to me. I
      wanted the exclusive privilege of more slavery, and so I staked a copper
      prospect, which later I discovered to consist of uncounted acres of
      country rock and about twenty-five dollars' worth of copper stain.
      In order to save a hundred dollars I did my own assessment work, drove a
      pick into my foot, developed blood-poison, went to the hospital, and was
      nice and helpless when the panic came along the middle of the month. The
      bank went bust, and my ready cash went with it; I couldn't give my
      mining stocks away. Everybody knew I was a pauper&mdash;everybody but the
      doctor. He persisted in regarding me as a millionaire and sent me a bill
      for five thousand dollars.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How perfectly outrageous! Why, Caliph, I would have let him sue me.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I would have, too&mdash;but I didn't. I induced him to settle
      for one hundred thousand shares of stock in my copper prospect. The par
      value was a dollar a share, and I was going to sell a block at ten cents,
      but in view of his high professional standing I let him have it for a
      nickel a share. I imagine he still has it. I bought back later all the
      other stock I sold, because the property was worthless, and in order to be
      a sport I offered him five hundred dollars for his block, but he thought I
      was trying to swindle him and asked five thousand.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Caliph!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wonderful game, isn't it&mdash;this game of life. So sweet
      when a fellow's taking chances! Now that I am fairly prosperous
      again, the only thing in life that really matters is the uncertainty as to
      whether, when finally I do leave Sobrante, I shall ride to the steamship
      landing in a hack or a hearse.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you could go in a hack this morning and avoid that uncertainty.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The millionaire drudge I told you of could have gone to five in a
      pretty villa on the Riviera, but she chose a miner's boarding-house.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then why,&rdquo; she persisted, &ldquo;did you leave the United
      States with the firm intention of remaining in Sobrante indefinitely,
      change your mind before you were here eight hours, and cable this Neddy
      Jerome person you would return in sixty or ninety days&mdash;and the
      following morning decide to remain, after all!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear young lady, if I changed my clothes as often as I change my
      mind, the what-you-may-call-'em chaps that manufacture Society Brand
      clothes couldn't keep me dressed.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But why?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That,&rdquo; he answered gravely, &ldquo;is a secret.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Women delight to pry into men's secrets.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know it. Had a friend once&mdash;married. Every night after
      dinner he used to sit and stare into the fire and his wife used to ask him
      what he was thinking about. He would look up at her owlishly and tell her
      it was something he couldn't explain to her, because she'd
      never understand it&mdash;and that was all he would tell her, although
      right frequently, I dare say, he felt like telling her something she could
      understand! She brooded over his secret until she couldn^t stand it any
      more, and one day she packed her duds and flew home to mother. He let her
      stay there three months, and finally one day he sent her a blueprint of
      what he'd been thinking about.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What was it?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;An internal-combustion engine. You see, until she left him, he'd
      never been able to get set to figure out something in connection with the
      inlet valves&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Stop right there, Caliph. I'm rebuked. I'll let you get
      set to think&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I didn't mean that. You let me get set yesterday&mdash;and I
      figured it all out then&mdash;and last night&mdash;and a minute ago. I don't
      care to do any more thinking to-day. Please talk to me.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you refuse to tell me why you cabled your friend Jerome?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You will never know. I told you it's a secret.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bet you I find out.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How much? That ten thousand dollars you expect to make from the
      flour-gold in your black-sand claim? And by the way, ten dollars, please.
      I won it for guessing you were interested in a mining proposition.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      She returned to him the bill she had won from him the day before. &ldquo;Ten
      thousand dollars suits me. Of course I haven't got the money just
      now, and this is what Billy calls a finger-bet, but if I lose, I guarantee
      to pay. Are we betting even money? I think that is scarcely fair. Under
      the circumstances I should be entitled to odds.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing doing! No odds on a bet of this nature to a seeress who has
      already jarred me from soul to vermiform appendix by making good! You know
      too blamed much already, and how you discovered, it is a problem that may
      drive me crazy yet.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      After breakfast they repaired to the veranda to await the result of
      Webster's experiment with Don Juan Cafetéro. Sure enough, the wreck
      had again returned; he was seated on the edge of the veranda waiting for
      them; as they approached, he held up a grimy, quivering hand, in the palm
      of which lay&mdash;a five-dollar gold-piece.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What?&rdquo; Mr. Webster said, amazed. &ldquo;Still unchanged!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I thried to change it at half a dozen <i>cantinas</i>,&rdquo; Don
      Juan wheezed, &ldquo;but divil a bit av systim did any av thim have. Wan
      offered this in spiggoty money an' the other offered that, an'
      sure if I'd taken the best that was offered me in exchange, ye might
      have t'ought I'd tuk more nor wan dhrink.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bravo! Three long, loud, raucous cheers for Don Juan Cafetéro!&rdquo;
      Dolores cried. &ldquo;That's just exactly what he expected you to
      do, Don Juan.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Give a dog a bad name, an' 'twill shtick to him,&rdquo;
      the derelict replied resignedly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Was it a terrible task to come back without a drink, Don Juan?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He shivered. &ldquo;A shky-blue kangaroo wit' a pink tail an'
      green ears chased me into this <i>patio</i>, ma'am.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You're very brave, Cafferty. How does it feel to win back
      your self-respect?&rdquo; Webster asked him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Beggin' the young leddy's pardon&mdash;it feels like
      hell, sor.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Caliph, don't be cruel,&rdquo; Dolores pleaded. &ldquo;Call a
      waiter and give Don Juan what you promised him.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      So Webster went into the hotel bar and returned presently with a bottle of
      brandy and a glass, which he filled and held out toward Don Juan. &ldquo;One
      of the paradoxes of existence, Don Juan,&rdquo; he observed, &ldquo;lies
      in the fact that so many of the things in life that are good for us are
      bad for us. This jolt will disperse the menagerie and quiet your nerves,
      but nevertheless it is a nail in your coffin.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Don Juan proved himself a true Hibernian soldier of misfortune by jesting
      under fire. &ldquo;Whilst ye have the hammer in yer hand, sor, dhrive in
      another,&rdquo; he pleaded. Webster declined, however, and returned the
      bottle to the bar, where he had it marked for Don Juan and set aside, for
      it was his opinion, evolved from a vast experience with hard-drinking
      miners, that the only cure for poor, diseased Don Juan lay in a judicious
      application of hair from the dog that had bitten him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And this is another reason why I must stay here longer than I
      intended,&rdquo; he said softly to Dolores, indicating Don Juan with his
      thumb. &ldquo;He's just about ready to be poured back into the
      bottle, and I'm going to see if I cannot restore him to his original
      solid state. Experiments in chemistry always did fascinate me.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He bade her adieu, and accompanied by his protégé, strolled uptown on a
      shopping tour. Here he outfitted Don Juan neatly but not gaudily and added
      to his own personal effects two high-power sporting rifles, three
      large-calibre automatic pistols, and a plentiful supply of ammunition&mdash;after
      which he returned to the hotel, first having conducted Don Juan to a
      barber shop and given him instructions to report for orders and his midday
      drink the instant he should have acquired the outward evidences of
      respectability.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the hotel Webster found two messages awaiting him. One was from Billy
      Geary, up at San Miguel de Padua, advising him that everything was in
      readiness for a trip to the mine; the other was a note from Ricardo Ruey,
      but signed with his alias of Andrew Bowers. Webster read:
    </p>
    <p>
      My Dear Friend:
    </p>
    <p>
      Permit me to congratulate you on your marksmanship last night and to
      commend your forbearance in winging a gent where killing was not only
      justified but to be encouraged. You have, so I am authoritatively
      informed, completely buffaloed your two gentlemen. They cannot, in our own
      classical English, &ldquo;quite make you.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      However, this letter is not all gossip. A certain higher-up has at length
      been convinced that it would be extremely inadvisable to eliminate you
      now. It has been pointed out to this person that you are a prom. cit. up
      in your neck of the woods and dangerous to monkey with&mdash;personally
      and because such monkeying may lead to unpleasant complications with your
      paternal government. A far more artistic and effective way of raising hell
      with you has been suggested to this higher-up individual, and he has
      accepted it. Indeed, the plan pleased him so much that he laughed quite
      heartily. Really, it is quite diabolical, but remember, he who laughs last
      laughs best&mdash;and I'm the villain in this sketch.
    </p>
    <p>
      Barring accidents, my dear Webster, you are good for at least six weeks of
      existence. Beyond that I dare not guarantee you.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thine,
    </p>
    <p>
      Andrew Bowers.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That makes it nice,&rdquo; the recipient of this comforting
      communication soliloquized. He went up to his room, packed a duffle-bag
      with such belongings as he would find necessary during a prolonged stay in
      the mountains, and at luncheon was fortunate enough to find Dolores in the
      dining room when he entered. Again she motioned him to the vacant chair
      opposite to her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm going up to San Miguel de Padua this afternoon,&rdquo; he
      announced as he took his seat. A look of extreme anxiety clouded her
      lovely face, and he noticed it. &ldquo;Oh, there's no risk,&rdquo;
      he hastened to assure her. &ldquo;That scamp of a brother of yours,
      through his friends in high places, has managed to get me a reprieve.&rdquo;
      He handed her Ricardo's letter.
    </p>
    <p>
      She looked up, much relieved, from her perusal. &ldquo;And how long do you
      expect to be gone, Caliph?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Quite a while. I'll be busy around that dratted concession
      for a couple of weeks, surveying and assaying and what-all; then, while
      waiting for our machinery and supplies to arrive from the United States, I
      shall devote my spare time to hunting and fishing and reforming Don Juan
      Cafetéro. The cool hills for mine.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What a selfish, unsociable programme!&rdquo; she reflected. &ldquo;I
      wonder if it will occur to him to come down here once in a while and take
      me for a drive on the Malecon and talk to me to keep me from dying of
      ennui before I meet Ricardo. I'll wait and see if he suggests it.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      However, for reasons best known to himself and the reader, Mr. Webster
      made no such interesting suggestion; so she decided that while he was
      tremendously nice, he was, nevertheless, a very queer man and thoroughly
      exasperating.
    </p>
    <p>
      Before leaving that day Webster turned over to her a steamer-trunk filled
      with books, and with something of the feeling of a burglar about to rob a
      bank, asked her if she would care to ride down to the station with him.
      &ldquo;Sort of speeding the parting guest, you know,&rdquo; he explained
      comfortably, for somehow, at that moment, he felt a trifle untrue to Billy
      Geary. Of course, Dolores, having nothing more pleasurable or exciting to
      do, would&mdash;and did. At the station they found Don Juan waiting in
      charge of the baggage.
    </p>
    <p>
      Just before the train pulled out John Stuart Webster took Dolores's
      hand. &ldquo;Good-bye, Seeress,&rdquo; he said very soberly. &ldquo;The
      trail forks here for the first time&mdash;possibly the last, although I'll
      try to be on hand to make good on my promise to present you to your
      brother the day he occupies the palace. However, if I shouldn't be
      in town that day, just go up and introduce yourself to him. It's
      been wonderful to have met you and known you, even for such a brief
      period. I shall never forget you and the remarkable twenty-four hours just
      passed.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shall not soon forget them myself, Caliph&mdash;nor you,&rdquo;
      she added. &ldquo;Haven't you been a busy little cup of tea, Caliph!
      Within twenty-four hours after landing, you have changed your mind three
      times, lost the best job in the world, had your fortune told, been marked
      for slaughter, acquired a new-found friend and commenced actively and with
      extraordinarily good results the work of reforming him, soused a gentleman
      in the fountain, spurned another with the tip of your boot, rode with me
      around the Malecon and listened to the band concert, bundled poor Billy
      off to San Miguel de Padua, received a challenge to fight a duel, accepted
      it, had it rejected, engaged in a street fight and shot a man through the
      hand, discovered my brother presumed to be dead, and received a reprieve
      from your enemies, while they perfect new plans for destroying you.
      Really, you are quite a caliph.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, there's a dash of speed in the old horse yet, Miss Ruey,&rdquo;
      he assured her laughingly. &ldquo;Now listen: don't tell anybody
      about your brother, and don't tell Billy about my adventures since
      he left for San Miguel de Padua.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I'm not liable to see Billy&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, you are&mdash;extremely liable. I'm going to send him
      back to you as soon as I can spare him, because I know you'll be
      lonesome and bored to death in this lonesome town, and Bill is bully good
      company. And I don't want you to tell him about the mess I'm
      in, because it would only worry him; he can't aid me, and the
      knowledge that I was in any danger, real or fancied, would be sufficient
      to cause him to rebel against my plans for his honeym&mdash;for his
      vacation. He'd insist on sticking around to protect me.&rdquo; He
      looked down at her little hand where it rested in his, so big and brown
      and hard; with his free hand be patted her hand paternally. &ldquo;Good-bye,
      Seeress,&rdquo; he said again; and turning to the steps, he leaped aboard
      just as the train started to move out of the station.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Go&mdash;good-bye&mdash;Caliph,&rdquo; she called mournfully. Then
      to herself: &ldquo;Bless his heart, he did remember I'd be terribly
      lonely, after all. He isn't a bit queer, but oh, dear, he is <i>so</i>
      exasperating. I could bump his kind old head against a wall!&rdquo; She
      turned her back on the train, fearful that from where he clung on the
      steps he could, even at that distance, see the sudden rush of tears that
      blinded her. However, Don Juan Cafe-téro, with his rubicund nose to the
      window of the last coach, did see them&mdash;saw her grope toward the
      carriage waiting to take her back to the hotel.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, shure, the poor darlint's cryin',&rdquo; he
      reflected. &ldquo;Be the Great Gun an Athlone! Shure I t'ought all
      along 'twas Billy Geary she had her eye on&mdash;God love him! An'
      be the same token, didn't she tell me I was to shtay sober an'
      take care av Masther Webster? Hah-hah-a-a-a! Well! I'll say nothin'
      an' I'll be neuthral, but&mdash;but&mdash;but&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      From which it may be inferred that romance was not yet burned out of Don
      Juan's Gaelic soul. He would be &ldquo;neuthral,&rdquo; but&mdash;but&mdash;but&mdash;he
      reserved the right to butt in!

      CHAPTER XX
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">T</span>HROUGHOUT the
      slow, tortuous journey, while the train crept up and ever upward into the
      hills, Don Juan entertained his patron with alternate snatches of the song
      closest to his heart (or rather his stomach)&mdash;&ldquo;The Cruiskeen
      Lawn,&rdquo; which, liberally translated for the benefit of those not
      familiar with the Gaelic, means &ldquo;the morning's morning.&rdquo;
      Between verses the outcast suggested the advisability of a drink to ward
      off approaching faintness or discoursed most learnedly on the roadbed,
      which was a tribute to his efficiency as a section-boss in his other
      incarnation.
    </p>
    <p>
      Arrived at San Miguel de Padua about midnight, Webster found the climate
      temperate, in fact, decidedly cool. Billy was waiting for them and was
      properly amazed, but not scandalized when Don Juan Cafetéro, abusing the
      station hands in a horrible hodgepodge of English and Spanish,
      superintended the landing of the baggage on the platform.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I had to bring him with me,&rdquo; Webster explained. &ldquo;I'm
      going to wean him, and after that baby quits crying for his bottle,
      believe me, Bill, we'll have the prince of a foreman for our Mine.
      Quite a character, is Don Juan, when you dig down into him.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dig far enough into that ruin and you'll find firecrackers,&rdquo;
      Billy admitted. &ldquo;However, John, I'm afraid he won't
      explode. The powder's damp. How did you leave Dolores?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Fit as a fiddle, Bill.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How does she stack up on better acquaintance, Johnny?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She's a skookum lass. She sent her love and I promised to
      send you back to her P. D. Q. So don't bother me with talk about
      her. If you think you're going to sit by my bed half the night and
      talk about your heart's desire, you've another guess coming.
      You'll see her again in a week or ten days, I hope.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No? Is that so, Johnny? Bully for you, you old wampus cat. Tell Don
      Juan to steer you over to the Globo de Oro. He knows the place. I've
      got to go and hire a mule or some other quadruped for, Don Juan if we're
      to avoid a late start in the morning. Good-night, old fellow.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      They were up at daybreak, and with three heavily laden pack-mules in
      charge of two semi-naked <i>mozos</i>, while the cook jogged comfortably
      along on his big splay feet in the rear, they set out for Billy's
      concession. From San Miguel de Padua they turned west on a splendid
      highway paved with limestone blocks and vending up into the hills on an
      easy gradient.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Government built, this, I dare say,&rdquo; Webster suggested as
      they trotted along side by side.
    </p>
    <p>
      Billy nodded. &ldquo;It is the only evidence I have observed of an
      inclination on the part of President Sarros to give the lowly peon a run
      for his taxes. This highway stretches from San Miguel de Padua to the
      western national boundary; I imagine Sarros built it with some idea of
      enabling him to get there first with the most guns in the event of war
      with his neighbours on the Pacific side. Quite a rare plucked 'un,
      is Sarros&mdash;to quote Mother Jenks.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you acquainted with him, Bill? What kind of a bird is he?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, yes, indeed, I know him. We're great <i>amigos</i>. I'm
      the man that taught him the folly of betting too heavily on two pair after
      the draw. He has Indian blood in him&mdash;quite a little of it, in fact;
      but he is well educated. Speaks French, Spanish, and English very
      fluently. He's a short man and wears high-heeled boots to make
      himself look taller than he really is. He is crafty, suspicious,
      sensitive, and possessed of a sense of humour&mdash;only his humour is
      tinged with cruelty. He'd steal a cross off a grave and kill his
      best friend as quickly, should political expediency demand it, as you or I
      would kill a rattlesnake. He has a rattling good intelligence-department,
      pays liberally for information, and keeps down rebellion by the simple
      process of locating the ringleaders and shooting them. He bumped off old
      General Morelos some six weeks ago&mdash;did it on mere suspicion, too.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You must have come to Sobrante mighty well recommended to get into
      the good graces of the scoundrel.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not at all! Sarros is a peculiar man. It pleases him to pose as a
      democrat and mingle freely with the proletariat&mdash;accompanied,
      however, by a strong bodyguard. Frequently he visits the cafés in
      Buenaventura and fraternizes with all and sundry. I met him first in a
      joint known as The Frenchman's, where he used to come to watch the
      drawing for the lottery. I was there matching another American for
      half-dollars, and Sarros edged up, all interest, and homed in on the game.
      Before the session was over we'd swapped cards, and the instant he
      learned I was a mining man and down here to give Sobrante the onceover, he
      invited me up to the palace for dinner. Our acquaintance quickly ripened
      into friendship&mdash;on his part. It seems he likes to have enterprising
      Americans come to Sobrante and exploit the country, because experience has
      demonstrated that if the visitors develop a good thing, there is always a
      rake-off in it for Sarros.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Webster nodded. &ldquo;Same old game anywhere you go south of the Rio
      Grande,&rdquo; he replied.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I had a couple of thousand dollars I'd saved on a job I had
      down in Rhodesia, so I was enabled to put up a big front. I received
      government permission to prospect government lands, and&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you pay a royalty to the government, Bill?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Five per cent.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How about the president's rake-off?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, that's unofficial, of course, but it's understood
      we pay him 5 per cent, of our output.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Anybody else to take care of?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, that cleans up the gang. Loaiza, the Minister of the Interior,
      wanted in, but I kicked like a bay steer and Sarros shooed him off.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A fine lot of bandits to do business with!&rdquo; Webster declared
      disgustedly. &ldquo;Still, it's their way of doing business, and
      much as we dislike that kind of business, we'll have to do it that
      way or not at all. The government ought to get 10 per cent, of our gross
      output, and Sarros ought to be shot. However, I dare say we can stand for
      the blackmail if, as you say, you have twelve-dollar ore.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wait and assay it yourself,&rdquo; Billy assured him. For thirty
      miles they followed the government highway, and then debouched to the
      southwest along a neglected road just wide enough to accommodate the
      clumsy oxcarts of the peons. The country was sparsely settled and
      evidently given over to stockraising. By degrees the road lost itself in
      the tall, dry grass, and became a faint trail which led into a forest of
      fir and other woods, with a good deal of mahogany and with very little
      underbrush. Billy rode in front, following through the timber a trail of
      his own blazing; and on the afternoon of the third day they dropped
      swiftly into a bare brown valley lying between timbered hills, displaying
      here and there the red stain of oxide of iron, from which evidence Webster
      knew he was in a mineral country. Billy pointed to a yellow mound at the
      base of one of the toes of the range flanking the valley on the south.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There's the claim,&rdquo; he announced. &ldquo;You can see
      the dump from here.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      A ribbon of green ran down a canon from the south and out into the brown,
      parched valley, where it suddenly disappeared.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sink,&rdquo; Billy elucidated, following the direction of his
      friend's gaze and divining his thoughts. &ldquo;That creek lies
      entirely on our concession&mdash;about thirty miner's inches of
      water, I should judge. It disappears in the sands out there at the end of
      the green streak, but the irrigation along its banks has been sufficient
      to insure plenty of good feed for our stock.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Darkness had descended on the valley by the time they had pitched camp and
      eaten supper. They were up at dawn the following morning, however, and
      immediately after breakfast Jack Webster went to his duffle-bag and
      brought forth a dozen little canvas sacks and a prospector's hammer.
      &ldquo;Now then, William, my son,&rdquo; he announced, &ldquo;light the
      lantern and we'll see if you've forgotten all I taught you
      about mining.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      They clambered up the dump to a point where two v light steel rails
      projected over the edge. On top of the dump, lying beside the rails, were
      two small, rusty, steel ore cars; the rails led from the edge of the dump
      to the mouth of a tunnel in the hillside and disappeared therein.
    </p>
    <p>
      Webster stood a moment, looking round him. &ldquo;How did you happen to
      locate this ledge?&rdquo; he demanded. &ldquo;Was it grass-root stuff,
      with an out-cropping here at the foot of the hill? No, of course it wasn't.
      You haven't enough ore on the dump. What the devil were you driving
      at?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Only a small portion of that dump is mine, Jack, and I didn't
      locate the ground originally. I came into this valley from the south, and
      as I worked up the range, I found a bald spot close to the top of the
      hill, and a gallows-frame over an abandoned shaft. Naturally, I went down
      the shaft to see why it had been abandoned. To my surprise, I found a
      twelve-foot vein of free-milling ore, on a contact between andesite and
      Silurian limestone. The ledge stood straight up and down, which seemed to
      argue great depth.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Somebody had found an outcropping on top of that hill,&rdquo;
      Webster declared with conviction, &ldquo;and sunk a shaft on the vein to
      open it up and determine its width and direction. How deep was this old
      shaft? Thirty or forty feet?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thirty-two feet. I figured it out just that way, too. After
      determining approximately which way the ledge was pitching, I made up my
      mind I'd have a tunnel driven to cut the ledge at right angles at
      the foot of the hill, since no practical man would mine from the top of a
      hill and hoist his ore through a shaft, when he could mine from the bottom
      and haul his ore out on cars through a tunnel. So I came prowling down
      into the valley and found this tunnel. The work had been abandoned for a
      couple of years, and after examining the tunnel I thought I knew why. They
      had failed to cut the ledge as they expected.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hum-m! And what did you do, Bill?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I got my transit and ran a line from the shaft on the hill,
      following the direction in which the ledge was running, and marked out the
      exact point toward the base of the hill where I would start my tunnel to
      cut the ledge. To my surprise, I discovered my predecessor had selected
      that identical spot. So I verified my calculations and then sat down to
      think it over.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You should have suspected a fault immediately.&rdquo; Webster
      chided the younger man. &ldquo;This is a volcanic country&mdash;&mdash;-&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; Billy interrupted, &ldquo;I suspected a fault, but not
      immediately. Remember I'm fifteen years your junior, professor. I
      remembered that frequent and violent earthquakes occur in this country,
      and it seemed to me a reasonable hypothesis to blame some ancient and
      particularly violent seismic disturbance, which had faulted the vein and
      set it over a considerable distance. According to my calculation, that
      other man should have cut the vein at eighty-three feet&mdash;yet he had
      gone on one hundred and two before quitting. So I got half a dozen peons
      and drove ahead nineteen feet on the other fellow's tunnel; and by
      Heck, Johnny, I cut the vein!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bully boy! And then?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I drifted ten feet on the vein, and the ore suddenly gave out. It
      stopped just like that, proving I'd come to the upper end of the
      vein where it had faulted; so I just worked up and around, stoping and
      sinking a winze here and there, until just about the time my cash reserve
      was getting pretty low I picked up the true vein and opened it up for the
      full width. Come in, and I'll show you.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      They entered the tunnel, to the signal dismay of dozens of large bats.
      When they reached the vein, Webster broke off samples of the ore every
      three or four feet, crawled after Billy up through the stope and back to
      the true vein, from the face of which he also took numerous samples; then
      he crawled out into the sunshine again, hot, dirty, and perspiring.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Billy, you'll be a real miner yet; see if you won't,&rdquo;
      was all the praise he tendered his youthful partner, standing beside him
      in anticipation of a compliment, as Webster got out his portable assay
      outfit.
    </p>
    <p>
      For three days Webster worked, determining the values of each sample, only
      to find that his assays confirmed Billy's. Then he visited the old
      shaft on top of the hill, assayed samples procured there, roamed the range
      in the immediate vicinity, marking with expert eye the timber he would
      find so useful and close at hand when stulls and lagging for the tunnel
      should be needed; then he selected a site where the waters of the stream
      could be impounded in a little draw far up the hillside, and returned to
      camp to render his final report.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You were right, son,&rdquo; he announced. &ldquo;This mine is a
      humdinger and no mistake; if you and I live ten years we'll be worth
      ten millions between us&mdash;maybe more.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Billy's jaundiced eyes glowed hungrily. &ldquo;We'll put in a
      hundred stamps&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, we'll try ten for a starter,&rdquo; Webster interrupted
      dryly, &ldquo;and add more as the mine pays its way. Our first
      consideration is the building of about ten miles of road through that
      timber, and repairs to that old dirt road connecting with the Grand
      Highway. I noticed there isn't much hard rock work to do, however,
      and we'll shoot the trees out of our way with dynamite. After we
      have a passable trail broken into this valley it won't take long to
      haul in our freight from the railroad at San Miguel de Padua. We'll
      cut all our frame- and foundation-timbers for the stamp-mill right here on
      the ground, and our other buildings will all be adobe. We'll have to
      put in a concrete dam up there on the hill and build a flume to the
      stamps. Oh, yes, my son, we'll run the stamps by water power. We'll
      have a five-hundred-foot drop at an ample angle, with the last hundred
      feet almost perpendicular; believe me, when the water comes through the
      penstock, anything in front will have to get out of the way. The same
      power will operate a little electric-light plant to light the grounds and
      buildings and workings, run the drills, and so on. Yes, it's the
      sweetest mining proposition on earth&mdash;only, like all high-class
      goods, it has one flaw when you examine it closely.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You're crazy,&rdquo; Billy challenged. &ldquo;Name the flaw!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sarros!&rdquo; Webster replied smilingly. &ldquo;That scoundrel
      makes a gamble out of an otherwise sure thing. However,&rdquo; he added,
      recalling the note received from Ricardo Ruey just before his departure
      from Buenaventura and reflecting that to be forewarned is to be forearmed,
      &ldquo;we'll accept the gamble. That rascal can't live
      forever, and he may be eliminated before he causes us any trouble.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What will it cost us to get this mine on a paying basis, Johnny*&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, back home, I'd figure on spending at least hundred
      thousand dollars; but I dare say, taking consideration the low cost of
      labour in Sobrante and the raw, natural resources of power and timber
      right on the ground, we ought to put this deal over for fifty thousand at
      the outside. Praise be, I have cash enough to do the trick without calling
      in any help, and such being the case, we'll not waste any time but
      hop to the job in a hurry and make the fur fly.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All right, Jack. What's the programme?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, first off, son, I'm not going to stay in this country
      and lose myself managing this mine. That's your job, because you're
      young and unimportant in your profession and have the ability to get away
      with the job. You can afford to spend the next fifteen years here, but I
      cannot. I can only afford to come down here every couple of years and
      relieve you for a vacation.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's the way I figured it, Jack.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All right then, Bill, let us start in by giving you your first
      vacation. If you're going to dig in here and make the fur fly, you've
      got to be in tip-top physical condition&mdash;and you are thin and gaunted
      and full of chills and fever. Just before I left Buenaventura I cashed a
      draft for five thousand dollars on my letter of credit at the Banco
      Nacional, and placed it to the credit of your account there.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To-morrow morning you will take your horse, one pack-mule, and one
      <i>mozo</i> and ride for San Miguel de Padua, where you will take the
      train for Buenaventura. In Buenaventura you may do what you blame please,
      but if I were you, boy, I'd try to get married and go back to the U.
      S. A. for my honeymoon. And when I finally hit a town that contained some
      regular doctors I'd let them paw me over and rehabbit me and
      overhaul my bearings and put me in such nice running order I'd be
      firing on all twelve cylinders at once.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And when I was feeling tip-top once more I'd wire old John
      Stuart Webster and tell him so, after which I'd stand by for a cable
      from the said sourdough inviting me to return and take up my labours.&rdquo;
      Billy's wan yellow face lighted up like a sunrise on the desert.
      &ldquo;I guess that plan's kind of poor,&rdquo; he announced
      feelingly. &ldquo;You're right, Jack. I'm in rotten condition
      and I ought to be right before I start. Still, if I should arrange to get
      married before I leave, I'd like mighty well to have a good man and
      true see me safely over the hurdles.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's nice, son, but I haven't time to be your best
      man. Arranging the honeymoon lets me out, Bill. I'm in a hurry to
      finish here and get back, so the sooner we both start our prospective jobs
      the sooner we'll finish. Have a quiet little marriage, Bill, without
      any fuss or feathers or voices breathing o'er Eden. What are the
      odds, provided you get hitched properly? Besides, I'm in mortal
      dread of that town of Buenaventura, The sewer system is bad; it's
      rotten with fever; and you'd better get that girl out of it P. D.
      Q., and the quicker the better. Myself, I prefer to stay up here in these
      mountains in a temperate climate where there are no mosquitoes.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Billy saw that Webster was serious and would resent any interference in
      his plans. &ldquo;All right, Jack,&rdquo; he assented. &ldquo;You're
      the boss.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Fine. Now, Bill, you listen to father and be guided accordingly.
      When you get to Buenaventura, wire the Bingham Engineering Company, of
      Denver, using my name, and tell them to add to my order given them last
      month and held for shipping directions, twelve dozen picks, twelve dozen
      shovels, twelve dozen mattocks, say, six dozen axes, brush knives, a big
      road plow, and whatever other things you happen to think of and which
      would come in handy when building our road. Also, when you get to New
      Orleans, buy a ton of dynamite and an adequate supply of fuse and
      fulminating caps, pay for it and ship it to me at Buenaventura. Further,
      look around in New Orleans and buy a stanch three ton motor truck. We'll
      need it for getting in supplies from San Miguel de Padua. Pay for the
      truck also, and if you go broke and cannot reach me by cable, wire Neddy
      Jerome at the Engineers' Club in Denver and kick his eye out in my
      honoured name.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I guess that's about all of your job, Bill. As for me, I'll
      camp right here. I'll have a deal of surveying to do and I plan to
      sweat the booze out of that Cafferty person. I'll make Don Juan my
      chain man and run the tail off him. Then I'll be busy with
      preliminary plans, arranging for labour and so on, and when I'm idle
      I'll go hunting.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      In conformity with this plan, therefore, Billy said good-bye to his friend
      and packed out for San Miguel de Padua bright and early next morning.
      During the following ten days Webster managed to keep himself fairly busy
      around the camp at the mine; then for a week he hunted and fished, and
      finally, when that began to pall on him, his agile mind returned to
      business and the consideration of the possibility of a flaw in Billy's
      title to the claim; whereupon he suddenly decided to return to
      Buenaventura and investigate that title fully before proceeding to throw
      dollars right and left. While socially he was wildly prodigal with his
      dollars, in business matters no Scotchman was more canny or more careful
      of his baubees.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the head of his little cavalcade, therefore, he rode out one morning
      for the railroad, whereat Providence, in its inscrutable wisdom, ordained
      that en route he should fall in with no less a personage than Don Ricardo
      Luiz Ruey, <i>ne</i> Andrew Bowers. Ricardo was mounted, armed, and alone,
      and at sight of Webster he shouted with delight and spurred toward him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What the devil! You, Rick, the government cut-up. What are you
      doing in these parts?&rdquo; Webster rode up and shook hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I'm Robin Hooding it around this part of the country. It
      is so secluded, you know, and Sarros hasn't any friends or any
      telegraph lines or any garrisons up this way. I heard in San Miguel de
      Padua that you were camped yonder, and I was on my way over to confer with
      you on matters of state.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You'll have to confer as we ride along. How does your
      business progress, Rick?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Beyond my wildest expectations. By the way, I need your help,
      friend Webster.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'll do anything within reason, Rick.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I figured you would, so I have already imposed on your good nature
      to a slight extent. Met your friend Geary at El Buen Amigo a couple of
      weeks ago, just before he sailed for the United States. He was telling me
      you had to have a lot of tools for road building, so I cabled in a secret
      cipher to the So-brantean revolutionary junta in New Orleans to ship these
      tools to you immediately. They arrived on the last trip of the <i>Atlanta</i>
      and now repose in Leber's warehouse waiting for you to call and
      remove them.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You scoundrel! What have you sent me?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A couple of hundred rifles and three machine-guns, branded axes,
      picks, shovels, plows, and so on. I also ran in three cases of ammunition,
      labelled grindstones, two more cases disguised as bolts, and quite several
      thousand labelled nails in kegs. I should feel rather sorry for you if my
      friend Sarros should get suspicious and investigate, but I haven't
      any fear that he will. You see, he knows you're here on legitimate
      business. He has investigated and learned that you are a bona fide mining
      engineer of considerable reputation&mdash;and then, you know, your friend
      Geary dickered with him for the concession. The mining property you are
      about to develop belongs to the people, not to Sarros; yet he has bartered
      it away and will divert the royalty to his own pocket instead of the
      public treasury.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hum-m-m! What do you want me to do with all those munitions
      consigned to me?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Arrange with Leber to keep them there until you get ready to build
      your road into the mine. I want them there when my American mercenaries
      arrive in Buenaventura. By the way, you are going to import these
      mercenaries for me. They are American miners and road-builders in the
      employ of the Honda Mining &amp; Development Company, which is to be the
      name of your enterprise. I hope you'll like the name, Webster. I
      picked it out myself.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You cool scoundrel! You're making a cat's paw out of
      me.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is because you happen to be so handy for my purpose. You see
      my plan, do you not? I'm going to attack Buenaventura from within
      and without. I'm going to come down on Sarros like a wolf on the
      fold, and the job is scheduled for next Saturday night a week.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Look here, Rick, my boy, I have no desire to mix in the politics of
      this country.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have some desire, however, to mix in its wealth,&rdquo; Ricardo
      reminded him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm the only man that can help you. By the way, do not order
      your machinery shipped until after I am seated firmly on the throne of my
      fathers.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's been framed with Sarros to let you spend your money on
      that concession and get the mine in running order; then a fake suit,
      alleging an error in the government survey, will be filed. It will be
      claimed that the concession given your friend Geary is, by virtue of
      erroneous government surveys, the property of a citizen of Sobrante. The
      courts here do as Sarros tells them. You are to be kicked out, busted, and
      despairing, and your nicely equipped little mine will be taken over as a
      government monopoly and run for the benefit of the government, to wit,
      Sarros and his satellites. We had to cook up a dirty deal like that to
      save your life. Of course, now that I have warned you in time, you are
      safe. We schemed a proposition, however, that worked both ways. It enabled
      us to save you and to save us, by permitting the shipment, free of
      suspicion, of arms for the rebels that are to attack the city from within.
      Naturally I had to cache their arms within the city&mdash;and that was a
      hard problem until you happened along. Thank you, fairy godfather.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My thanks are due you, Ricardo. I'm for you, first, last, and
      all the time, and against this Sarros outfit. By the way, how do you
      purpose moving your machine-guns?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We'll have to carry them, I guess.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I'll have a small auto-truck delivered in Buenaventura
      by that time. You might arrange to armour it with sheet steel; and with a
      couple of machine-guns mounted in it, and a crew of resolute Americans
      behind the machine-guns, you could caper from one end of the city to the
      other and clear a path for your infantry.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank you, my friend. I'll borrow the motor truck and arrange
      to armour it. That's a bully idea. Are you bound for Buenaventura
      now?&rdquo; Webster nodded. &ldquo;Then,&rdquo; Ricardo suggested, &ldquo;I'll
      meet you in my room at El Buen Amigo next Wednesday night at eleven and
      explain the details of my plans to you if you care to hear them. I think
      they're air-tight myself, but somehow I think I'd feel more
      certain of them if you approve them.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'll be there, Rick, and the day you run that outlaw Sarros
      off the grass you'll know why I am for you.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good-bye, old man. You will never know how grateful you have made
      me.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Ruey shook hands with Webster and rode off through the timber, leaving
      John Stuart Webster to pursue the even tenor of his way, until at length
      he arrived once more in Buenaventura and sought accommodations at the
      Hotel Mateo. And there, as he entered the lobby and gazed through a glass
      door across the <i>patio</i> and into the veranda, he saw that which
      disturbed him greatly. In a big wicker rocker Dolores Ruey sat, rocking
      gently and busily stitching on a piece of fancy work!
    </p>
    <p>
      Billy Geary gone back to the United States, and Dolores was still in
      Buenaventura! Amazing! Why, what the devil did Billy mean by letting her
      have her own way like that? Of course they hadn't been married, or
      she would not now be out there on the veranda, and of course they hadn't
      quarrelled, because that was an impossibility, and of course Billy had
      departed alone for the U. S. A., else he would have returned to their camp
      in the hills back of San Miguel de Padua.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I know what I'm going to do,&rdquo; Webster decided.
      &ldquo;I'm not going to be led into temptation while Billy's
      not on the job&mdash;so I'll not put up at the Hotel Mateo after
      all. I'll just sneak around to El Buen Amigo and fix it with that
      old Mother Jenks not to tip off my presence in town to Dolores Ruey until
      I can get the lay of the land and see what the devil has happened to all
      my well-laid plans.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He retreated out the front door and called a carriage, into which he was
      about to step, bag and baggage, when Don Juan Cafetéro came rushing up in
      great excitement. &ldquo;Sure, where are ye goin' now, sor. Is there
      no room for ye in the Hotel Mateo?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Their beds have jiggers in them, and I just remembered that,&rdquo;
      Webster fibbed. &ldquo;Hop in, John, and we'll drive around to Mr.
      Geary's lodgings in El Buen Amigo.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I come t'rough the <i>patio</i> just now,&rdquo; Don Juan
      explained, &ldquo;an' who should I meet but the young leddy.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You infernal scoundrel! Did you tell her I was in town?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sure I did, sor. An' why not?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;None of your infernal business. You've spoiled everything.
      You're a muddle-headed monkey and I've a great notion to let
      you get drunk again. Take the baggage back into the hotel.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Don Juan Cafetéro, greatly humbled and rebuffed, stepped aside and watched
      Webster stride back into the hotel. &ldquo;God love ye, sor,&rdquo; he
      mumbled, &ldquo;know-in' what I know, is it likely I'd let ye
      make a monkey out av her or yerself? Ye made yer plans wit' Misther
      Geary wit'out consultin' her. Now go, ye grrand big divil, an'
      find out why she kicked yer schame to smithereens.&rdquo; And with a
      solemn and knowing wink at the duffle-bag, Don Juan picked that article up
      and followed after his master.

      CHAPTER XXI
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">J</span>OHN STUART WEBSTER'S
      agile brain was the repository of many conflicting emotions as he bathed,
      shaved, and changed from his soiled khaki field clothes to a suit of ducks
      before presenting himself before Dolores.
    </p>
    <p>
      Had Billy's courage forsaken him at the last minute, with the result
      that he had gone back to the United States without having settled the
      question of Dolores's future? Had he proposed and been rejected, or
      had he proposed, been accepted, and had his plans for an immediate
      marriage vetoed by Dolores?
    </p>
    <p>
      In either event, why had Billy failed to leave a note for him at the Hotel
      Mateo, or mailed him a letter to the Globo de Oro at San Miguel de Padua,
      advising him of the change in the plan of action outlined for him by
      Webster?
    </p>
    <p>
      If Dolores had accepted him, then Billy Geary was just the sort of
      impulsive youth who could not rest until he had advised Webster of his
      luck; on the other hand, Billy was susceptible, in matters of love, to the
      deep melancholia which is as distinct a characteristic of the Hibernian
      nature as wit and light-heartedness, and in the event of disappointment he
      would not be apt to rush to his partner with the news; a feeling of
      chagrin would prompt him to keep his own counsel, to go away and stay away
      until he had Smothered the ache and could return and meet Dolores without
      restraint and embarrassment.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the simplicity of his single-hearted devotion Webster was puzzled to
      understand how any woman in her right mind could fail to fall in love with
      Billy Geary. To begin, he was a fine-looking lad and would look finer when
      the chills and fever had been eradicated; he was far from being a runt,
      mentally or physically; he was gentle, well-mannered, kind, with the gift
      of turning a pretty speech to a woman and meaning it with all his heart
      and soul. A man he was, from heels to hair, and a man with prospects far
      above the average. To Webster's way of thinking, the girl who
      married Billy might well count herself fortunate.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dolores greeted him with unaffected pleasure. &ldquo;Well, Caliph!&rdquo;
      she said. Just that. It made Webster sensible of a feeling of having
      returned to her after an absence of several years. &ldquo;I'm so
      glad to see you, Miss Ruey,&rdquo; he replied, and added boldly, &ldquo;particularly
      since I didn't expect to.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      She knew what her reply would lead to; nevertheless, with that
      dissimulation which can only be practised in perfection by a clever and
      beautiful woman, she answered with equal boldness: &ldquo;Indeed! Pray
      why?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, for a pretty good reason, I think. A few weeks ago, after
      examining Bill's concession very thoroughly, I told him he was a
      potential millionaire. Now, while I disclaim any appearance of
      braggadocio, when John Stuart Webster, E.M., makes any mine owner a report
      like that, he is apt to be taken very seriously. And having made Bill a
      potential millionaire and arranged to give him three or four months'
      vacation back home, I had a notion he'd present to you a very valid
      reason why you should accompany him.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are very frank, Caliph.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's because I'm curious. You do not mind being
      equally frank with an old cuss like me, do you, and telling me just why
      Bill's plans miscarried? Because he had a certain dream, and told me
      about it, and I did my little best to make it come true. You see, Miss
      Ruey, I'm a lot older than Bill, and I've known him since he
      was eighteen years old; I feel a responsibility toward him that is almost
      paternal.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think I understand, Caliph. It would be very difficult, I think,
      for anybody to meet Billy without being attracted toward him. He's
      one of the dearest, most lovable boys in the world&mdash;and he did do me
      the signal honour of asking me to marry him. So there!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, and why didn't you?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      She smiled at his blunt insistence on forcing the issue. &ldquo;For a
      number of excellent reasons, Caliph. In the first place, he wanted me to
      marry him immediately&mdash;and I wasn't ready to leave Sobrante,
      while Billy was. Indeed, it was highly necessary that he should leave
      immediately, for the sake of his health, and I had Billy's interest
      at heart sufficiently to insist upon it. You seem to forget that when a
      girl marries she must make some preparation for the event, and if she has
      any close relatives, such as a brother, for instance, she likes to have
      that relative present at the ceremony. You will recall, Caliph, that I
      have a brother and that you have promised to introduce me to him very
      shortly. Much as you love Billy, would you insist upon depriving me of the
      joy of meeting my brother on the day of his triumph&mdash;on the day of
      the triumph of our family&mdash;just to please Billy by marrying him on
      ten minutes' notice, and leaving on a honeymoon next day? That is
      what you would refer to as crowding my hand and joggling my elbow.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By Judas, I never thought of that, Miss Ruey,&rdquo; the repentant
      Webster answered. &ldquo;In fact, I wasn't thinking of anybody's
      interest in this matter but Bill's.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not even of mine, Caliph?&rdquo; reproachfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That goes without saying. Could I have done anything nicer for you
      than fix it for Bill so he would be in position to marry you? Here you
      are, practically alone in the world&mdash;at least you were when Bill met
      you and fell in love with you&mdash;and I know that boy so well I was
      convinced, after meeting you, that his future happiness and yours would
      best be conserved if you married him. I hope you do not think I was
      presumptuous in thinking this, or that I am presumptuous now in speaking
      my mind so frankly. I realize this is a most unusual conversation&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Quite to be expected of an unusual man, Caliph. And I do not think
      you were one bit presumptuous. It was wonderfully dear of you, and I am
      profoundly grateful that Billy and I have such a true, unselfish friend,
      whose first thought is for our happiness. I knew I was going to like you
      before Billy introduced us&mdash;and I think more of you than ever, now
      that I know you're a dear, blundering old matchmaker. Of course you
      realize how badly I felt to think I couldn't accede to Billy's
      plan. Billy's such a dear, it quite broke my heart to disappoint
      him, but a little temporary unhappiness will not ruin Billy, will it? It
      makes me feel blue to talk about it, Caliph.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not at all, not at all, Miss Ruey. Bill is one of the impulsive,
      whirlwind kind, up in the clouds today and down in the slough of despond
      to-morrow. He'll survive the shock. Of course, it would have been
      pretty nice if your affairs had permitted you to accompany Bill; I never
      had a honeymoon myself, but it must be a great institution, and I was all
      wrapped up in the notion of seeing Bill have what I'd never had
      myself&mdash;a honeymoon and a wife and kids and money enough to enjoy
      'em all the way that God intended a real man and woman to enjoy
      them. However, I'm glad to know everything will come out all right.
      Seeing you here gave me a momentary chill; thought a cog had slipped
      somewhere, so I helped myself to Cupid's license and asked. A man
      cannot learn very much from a woman unless he asks questions, can he? I
      mean on the subject of love.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      She smiled a little, wistful, knowing smile. &ldquo;No, Caliph,&rdquo; she
      answered seriously, &ldquo;somehow the Master of Things ordained that on
      the subject of love man must do all the talking.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, but on the other hand, woman has the last word&mdash;as usual.
      However, the only thing in your case and Billy's that worries me is
      the thought that since Bill left his magnet behind he will be drawn back
      here before he is in the kind of shape, physically, that I want him to be
      in before he relieves me on the job so I can go away.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do not worry on that point, Caliph. I am your ally there; between
      us both I think we can manage him.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Fine business! Miss Ruey, if that boy Bill ever gets a notion in
      his head that you haven't forgotten more than he'll ever know,
      I'll break his neck. And with those few kind words we'll
      dismiss William until you care to talk about him again, although if you're
      as deep in love as Bill you'll not stay off the subject very long.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How is Don Juan Cafetéro, Caliph?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Coming out in the wash and without his colours running. I've
      sweated the booze out of him, hiking him over the hills, and bullied him
      into eating solids, and a few days ago I shut off the firewater forever, I
      hope. However, I'll have to watch him very closely for a long time
      yet&mdash;particularly in town. Out at the mine he'll be away from
      temptation. Hard work is the best cure for Don Juan. There's a deal
      of truth in the old saying that Satan will find mischief for idle hands to
      do. I imagine you've been rather idle lately. Hope you haven't
      been into mischief.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I haven't been idle. I've made several dresses for
      Mother Jenks and done a lot of fancy work and begun the study of my mother
      tongue. If my brother should become president of this country, it would
      ill become his sister not be able to speak Spanish. By the way, Billy told
      me you were going to remain up in the hills quite a while yet. What
      brought you back to town so soon?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Expected I'd have some freight arriving shortly: besides, I
      wanted to make certain the title to Bill's property didn't
      have any flaws in it.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How long will you remain in Buenaventura?&rdquo; Considering the
      fact that he was no longer subject to temptation, since the object of his
      temptation was now definitely promised to his friend Billy, Webster
      suddenly decided to remain until the political atmosphere should be
      cleared, although prior to his conversation with Dolores he had cherished
      a definite plan to go back to the hills within forty-eight hours. He could
      not suppress an ironic grin, despite the pain and misery of his
      predicament, as he reflected how often, of late, he had made up his mind
      to a definite course of action, only to change it promptly at some new
      whim of fate.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm going back,&rdquo; he replied soberly, &ldquo;after I
      have kept my promise and introduced you to your brother in the government
      palace. If I cannot introduce him to you there, the title to our mining
      concession will be clouded, in which event it will not be necessary for
      Billy or myself to fuss with it further.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He related to her the information gleaned from her brother two days
      previously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's no use for an individual to fight a government despot in
      courts controlled by the latter,&rdquo; he concluded. &ldquo;Your brother
      must win and depose the Sarros; then with the title to the property
      certified by the government as without a flaw, I may dare to spend fifty
      thousand dollars developing it.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And if my brother doesn't win?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I may never have an opportunity to present you to him. We mustn't
      be squeamish about this matter, Miss Ruey. If Ricardo doesn't turn
      the trick, he may go the way of his father, unless he can manage to get
      out of the country.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      She was silent a minute, digesting this grim alternative. &ldquo;And you?&rdquo;
      she queried presently. &ldquo;What will happen to you? As I understand it,
      you are existing now under a temporary license.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shall endeavour to leave also&mdash;with dignity. I can always
      land a pretty good job back home, and wherever I'm superintendent
      the next best job belongs to Billy. The Lord is our shepherd; we shall not
      want.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As I understand it, then, Caliph, Ricardo hopes to win his
      revolution when he strikes the first blow.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think so. I dare say Ricardo hopes to take Sarros by surprise,
      bottle the city garrison up in the <i>cuartel</i> and the government
      palace and there besiege them. Having secured nominal control of a
      seaport, he can import arms and ammunition; also he can recruit openly,
      and at his leisure hunt down the outlying garrisons. The Sarros crowd
      doesn't suspect his presence in Sobrante, and by a quick, savage
      stroke he should be able to jerk this one-horse government up by the heels
      in jig time&mdash;particularly since the citizenry feel no loyalty toward
      the Sarros régime and are only kept in subjection through fear and lack of
      a leader. I'm going to play Ricardo to win, if he isn't killed
      in the opening row, for I'm certain he'll lead his men.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I dare say he is greatly like his father&mdash;not afraid to die
      for his country,&rdquo; she replied presently. &ldquo;I am glad to be here
      when he takes that risk.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, but you mustn't be here,&rdquo; Webster protested.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because there'll be street fighting&mdash;probably of a
      desperate character, and I understand your countrymen go rather war-mad
      and do things not sanctioned by the Hague tribunal. If there's a
      steamer in port at the time I'll put you aboard her until the issue
      is decided. She'll have to remain in port because while the fighting
      goes on she cannot load or discharge.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I could go to the American consulate,&rdquo; she suggested.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You could&mdash;but you'll not. That consul would give you up
      to the first mob that called for you&mdash;and I'm not so certain
      that even the sister of an archtraitor (for patriots and revolutionists
      are always traitors when they lose) would be safe from the Sarros fury.
      However, I'm going to see Ricardo tomorrow night and learn the
      details of his plan of campaign; after that I'll be able to act
      intelligently.&rdquo;

      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">R</span>ICARDO RUBY, with
      Doctor Pacheco and Colonel Caraveo, were engaged in consultation when Jack
      Webster, having left the Hotel Mateo via his bedroom window in order to
      avoid possible espionage and made his way to El Buen Amigo on foot, was
      announced by Mother Jenks. The three conspirators greeted him joyously, as
      indeed they should, for his loyal friendship had thus far been one of
      their principal bulwarks.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; Webster inquired, after greeting them and carefully
      closing the door behind him, &ldquo;here I am in Beunaventura, marking
      time and, like Mr. Micawber, waiting for something to turn up.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You will not be required to wait long,&rdquo; Colonel Caraveo
      assured him. &ldquo;Thanks to your kindly offices, the trap is already
      baited.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Our friend Ruey has, since our first meeting, insisted on
      dispensing with my consent when using me to promote his enterprises,
      Colonel. Strange to say, I have been unable to berate him for his
      impudence. I was down at Leber's warehouse this afternoon. You have
      enough road-making tools consigned to me there to build a pretty fair
      highway to the gates of the government palace, I should say. I hope you
      have all pondered the result to me, an innocent bystander, if your enemies
      should take a notion to open one of those cases of shovels.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Colonel Caraveo favoured him with a benignant smile. &ldquo;You forget, my
      friend, that I am second in command in the Intelligence Department, and
      that, during the absence of your particular friend Raoul Sarros, in New
      Orleans, I am first in command. Since I already know what those cases
      contain, naturally I shall not take the trouble to investigate.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, that's a comfort, Colonel.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have investigated your mining concession, Webster?&rdquo;
      Ricardo Ruey asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You bet.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What did you find?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A couple of millions in sight.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Ricardo shook his head slowly. &ldquo;It is not in sight, old man,&rdquo;
      he reminded Webster. &ldquo;Without our aid&mdash;and you cannot have our
      aid unless our revolution is successful, when you shall have it freely&mdash;your
      millions are, most positively, not in sight. If you want those millions,
      friend Webster, there is but one way to get them&mdash;and that is to
      close your eyes and play our game to the limit.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It seems to me I've been showing a pretty willing spirit
      right along&mdash;and that without being consulted in the matter, Rick:&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You're one man in a million. I wonder if you'd go
      further&mdash;about forty thousand dollars further, to be exact.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I might, but I never go it blind for a wad like that. What's
      your trouble?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The revolution will fail if you decide to deny my request. I
      realize I have the most amazing presumption to ask anything of you, and
      yet I am moved to stake my all on your goodness of heart, having already
      had ample evidence of that goodness. In other words, I am going to apply
      the old principle of driving a willing horse to death.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The individual in charge of the funds of the revolutionary junta in
      New Orleans was murdered last night; the funds were deposited to his
      credit as agent in a certain bank, and before the junta can obtain legal
      possession of them again the psychological time for their use will have
      passed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We have a steamer chartered, and two hundred men, whose business it
      is to fight under any flag at five dollars gold per day and no questions
      asked, are now marking time on the Isle of Pines, off the coast of Cuba,
      waiting for our steamer to call for them and land them, with their rifles
      and ammunition and six seventy-five-millimeter field-guns and some
      rapid-fire Maxims, at San Bruno, some eighteen miles up the coast from
      here.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The guns and munitions are now in Tampa, having been shipped to our
      agent there on sight draft, with bill of lading attached; the steamer is
      chartered and en route to Tampa from Norfolk, Virginia, and we must pay
      the owners ten thousand dollars the day she begins taking on her cargo,
      and ten thousand dollars before she unloads it on lighters at San Bruno.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We must also pay two hundred men one month's pay in advance&mdash;that
      is, thirty thousand dollars; we cannot meet this expense and still take up
      that sight draft now awaiting our attention in the bank at Tampa.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In return for this favour to the provisional government of
      Sobrante, you shall have the note of the provisional government, signed by
      the provisional president, myself, and the provisional cabinet, Doctor
      Pachecho, Colonel Caraveo, and two other gentlemen whom you will meet in
      due course unless in the interim they should be killed. And as a bonus for
      saving this country from a brutal dictator, who is pillaging its resources
      for his personal profit, you shall have a deed of gift to that mining
      concession you and your friend Geary are so desirous of working; also the
      title shall be certified by the government and the Supreme Court of
      Sobrante and absolutely secured to you against future aggression in the
      event that the new régime should be overthrown at some future date. Also
      you have my profound gratitude and that of my people.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tell me your plan of campaign,&rdquo; Webster suggested.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In a secret rendezvous in the mountains I have one thousand picked
      men&mdash;my father's veterans. They are armed with modern rifles
      and machetes. The nitrate company, which has been suffering from heavy
      export duties imposed by Sarros, would help us financially, I think, but
      it is not well for a provisional government to begin by asking financial
      favours of a huge foreign corporation; so, much to the surprise of their
      local manager, to whom I have confided my plans, I have merely asked for
      the loan of all the rolling stock of the railroad for one night. It will
      be mobilized at San Miguel de Padua by next Saturday night; my troops will
      arrive late the same afternoon and entrain at once.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In the interim all telephone and telegraph communications with
      Buenaventura will be severed. The night previous our steamer will have
      discharged her cargo of men and munitions at San Bruno; a chain of
      outposts will at once be established and all communication with the
      capital will be shut off.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;On Saturday night, also, the Consolidated Fruit Company's
      steamer <i>La Estrellita</i> will make port with thirty Americans in her
      steerage. These men will be road-makers and miners imported by Mr. J. S.
      Webster, and in order to make certain that they will come, you have
      already ordered them by cable. I took the liberty of seeing to it that the
      cable signed by you was sent to New Orleans several days ago, and as part
      of the bluff of keeping all of your movements under surveillance, a copy
      of this cablegram was furnished to the subordinate of our good Colonel
      Caraveo, charged with reporting on your movements. We have arranged with
      the port doctor to give <i>La Estrellita</i> a clean bill of health the
      very night she arrives. Hence the ship's authorities will not be
      suspicious, I hope, when we remove our men after dark and house them in
      Leber's warehouse, where they will spend the night unpacking those
      spades, picks, and shovels of yours and getting the factory grease off
      them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;At four o'clock in the morning various citizens of Sobrante,
      with rebellion in their hearts, will begin to mobilize at Leber's
      warehouse, where they will be issued rifles and ammunition and where they
      will wait until the action is opened to the south by the detachment from
      San Bruno, which, having marched from San Bruno the night before, will
      have arrived outside, the city, and will be awaiting the signal from me. I
      will attack from the west&mdash;cautiously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, there are five thousand government troops in the city and in
      various cantonments on the outskirts. These cantonments are to be rushed
      and set afire; I figure that the confusion of our sudden attack will
      create a riot&mdash;particularly when I do something that isn't very
      popular as a war feature down this way, and that is charge&mdash;and keep
      on coming. Down this way, you know, Webster, a battle consists in a
      horrible wastage of ammunition at long range, and casualties of three
      killed and twelve wounded. The good, old-fashioned charge isn't to
      their liking; they hate cold steel.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;These government troops will start to fall back on the city, only
      to find themselves flanked by a fierce artillery fire from the San Bruno
      contingent; the troops from the arsenal, the Guards at the palace and the
      Fifteenth Regiment of Infantry, now stationed at the Cuartel de
      Infanteria, next the government palace, will be dispatched post haste to
      repulse the attack, and four hundred men, with the machine-gun company
      waiting in Leber's warehouse, will promptly move upon them from the
      rear and capture the arsenal. There are a few thousand rifles and a lot of
      ammunition stored there; I miss my guess if, as soon as the news of its
      capture by the rebels spreads through the city (and I shall have men to
      spread it), I shall not have a few thousand volunteers eager to help
      overthrow Sarros.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When the government troops find themselves under the kind of
      shell-fire I've prepared for them, and with machine guns and Maxims
      playing on them, in close formation from the rear, they'll surrender
      in droves&mdash;if they live to surrender.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Once cut off from the arsenal and the palace, Sarros must fight his
      way out of the city in order to have the slightest chance to suppress the
      rebellion, for he will have no refuge in the city. And with the railroad
      and all the rolling stock in our hands, without a commissary for his
      troops, without a base of supplies, even should the government troops
      fight their way through, they leave the city in my hands and I'll
      recruit and arm my men and hunt them down like jack-rabbits at my leisure.
      Once let the arsenal and the palace fall into my hands, once let me
      proclaim myself provisional president, once let the people know that
      Ricardo Ruey, the Beloved, lives again in the person of his son, and I
      tell you, Webster, this country is saved.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You lead the army from San Miguel de Padua, Ricardo. Who leads the
      detachment from San Bruno?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Colonel Caraveo.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And the machine-gun company from Leber's warehouse?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Doctor Pacheco. How do you like my plan of campaign?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It couldn't be any better if I had planned it myself. You
      might accept my suggestion and armour that little motor truck of mine. It
      arrived on yesterday's steamer.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And some armour sheet steel with it&mdash;sheet steel already
      loopholed for the barrels of the two machine guns it will carry!&rdquo;
      Doctor Pacheco cried joyously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have you provided a chauffeur, Doctor?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have&mdash;likewise an armoured sheet-steel closet for him to sit
      in while chauffeuring.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don't forget the oil and gasoline,&rdquo; Webster cautioned
      him quizzically.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How about that loan to the provisional government?&rdquo; Ricardo
      demanded pointedly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Webster did not hesitate. After all, what was money to him now? Moreover,
      he was between the devil and the deep sea, as it were. Billy had gone
      away, his hopes raised high, already a millionaire after the fashion of
      mining men, who are ever ready to count their chicks before they are
      hatched, provided only they see the eggs. Besides, there was Dolores. Full
      well Webster realized that Billy, tossed back once more into the jaws of
      the well-known wolf of poverty, would not have the courage upon his return
      to Sobrante to ask Dolores to share his poverty with him; should the
      revolution fail, Ricardo Ruey would be an outcast, a hunted man with a
      price on his head, and in no position to care for his sister, even should
      he survive long enough to know he had a sister. Webster thought of her&mdash;so
      sweet, so winsome, so brave and trusting, so worthy of all that the world
      might hold for her of sweetness and comfort. She would be alone in the
      world if he, John Stuart Webster, failed her now&mdash;more than ever she
      needed a man's strength and affection to help her navigate the
      tide-rips of life, for life to a woman, alone and unprotected and
      dependent upon her labour for the bread she must eat, must contain, at
      best, a full measure of terror and despair and loneliness. He pictured her
      through a grim processional of years of skimping and petty sacrifices&mdash;and
      all because he, John Stuart Webster, had hesitated to lend a dreamer and
      an idealist a paltry forty thousand dollars without security.
    </p>
    <p>
      No, there was no alternative. As they say in Mexico, Ricardo had him <i>tiron</i>,
      meaning there was no escape. If his friendship for Billy was worth a sou,
      it was worth forty thousand dollars; if his silent, unrequited love for
      Dolores Ruey was worthy of her, no sacrifice on his part could be too
      great, provided it guaranteed her happiness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ruined again,&rdquo; he sighed. &ldquo;This is only another of
      those numerous occasions when the tail goes with the hide. How soon do you
      want the money?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Ricardo Luiz Ruey leaned forward and gazed very earnestly at John Stuart
      Webster. &ldquo;Do you really trust me that much, my friend?&rdquo; he
      asked feelingly. &ldquo;Remember, I am asking you for forty thousand
      dollars on faith.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Old sport,&rdquo; John Stuart Webster answered, &ldquo;you went
      overboard in Buenaventura harbour and took a chance among those big,
      liver-coloured, hammerheaded sharks. And you did that because you had a
      cause you thought worth dying for. I never knew a man who had a cause that
      was worth dying for who would even espouse a cause worth swindling for.
      You win&mdash;only I want you to understand one thing, Ricardo: I'm
      not doing this for the sake of saving that mining concession the Sarros
      government gave my friend Geary. I'm above doing a thing like this
      for money&mdash;for myself. It seems to me I must do it to guarantee the
      happiness of two people I love: my friend Geary and the girl he's
      going to marry. I reject your promissory note and your promise of a deed
      of gift for that concession, and accept only your gratitude. There are no
      strings to this loan, because it isn't a loan at all. It's a
      bet. If you lose, I'll help you get out of the country and absolve
      you of any indebtedness to me. We'll just make a new book and start
      making bets all over again, Rick. However, if you should win, I know you'll
      reimburse me from the national treasury.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you do not desire a bonus?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing that will cost the citizens of this country one penny of
      their heritage. I'm going to bet this money&mdash;bet it,
      understand, not loan it, because a loan predicates repayment at some
      future date, and for the sake of my self-respect as a business man I'd
      hate to make a bum loan of that magnitude on no security. However, if you
      want to be a sport and grant me a little favour in return, you can.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Name it, friend.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As soon as you have been recognized by the United States, I want
      you to have your ambassador in Washington make representations to my
      government that the present American consul in Sobrante is not acceptable
      to your government. That fellow is a disgrace to my native land and I want
      him fired.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It shall be my first official act after freeing my country from a
      tyrant's yoke.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Another little favour also, Ricardo.&rdquo; This time Webster spoke
      in English.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Eire away.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;After I give you this money, I don't want the Doctor and the
      Colonel to kiss me to show how grateful they are.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You wonderful fellow! Jack Webster, if I had a sister I should want
      her to marry you.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Shows how little you'd think of your sister&mdash;staking her
      to a sentimental jackass. Shall I cable the money to New Orleans in the
      morning? I have a letter of credit for my entire bank-roll, and I can give
      a draft at the Banco Nacional, and have them cable a New Orleans bank.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That will do very nicely.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To whom shall I cable the money?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Send it to the Picayune National Bank of New Orleans, with
      instructions to credit account Number 246, J. E. P., trustee. In this
      little game we are playing, my friend, it is safer to deal in numbers and
      initials rather than names. The local cable office leaks quite regularly.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very well, Ricardo, I'll attend to it first thing in the
      morning. Where are you going to armour that motor truck?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you'll have it run over to the nitrate company's
      machine shop at the railway terminus the foreman there will attend to the
      job and keep the truck under cover until Friday night, when they'll
      run it back to Leber's warehouse for the machine guns Sunday
      morning.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is Leber in on this deal?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He is not. What Leber doesn't know will not worry him. He
      doesn't live in his warehouse, you know. We're just going to
      take possession after dark, when the water-front is absolutely deserted.
      There's a concert on the Malecon that night, and everybody who can
      ride or walk will be out there listening to it.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Webster nodded his approval of Ricardo's clever plans. &ldquo;All
      right, old man, go to it and win, or there'll be several new faces
      whining around the devil, not the least of which will be mine. When you
      charge, remember you're charging for my forty thousand dollars&mdash;and
      go through with it. I worked rather hard for that forty thousand, and if I
      must lose it, I do not want to do it in a half-hearted fight. Give me, at
      least, a bloody run for my money. I'll have a reserved seat
      somewhere watching the game.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you'll take my advice, you'll go aboard <i>La
      Estrellita</i> and stay there until the issue is decided. When the first
      gun is fired, it signals the open season on mining engineers who butt in
      on affairs of state.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What! And me with a healthy bet down on the result! I hope I'm
      a better sport than that.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You're incorrigible. Be careful, then, and don't get
      yourself potted by a stray bullet. When these brownies of mine get
      excited, they shoot at every head in sight.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Shall I see you fellows before the blow-off?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I scarcely think so.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then if you're through with me, I'll bid you all
      good-bye and good luck. I'll have dinner with you in the palace
      Sunday evening.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Taken.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;May I bring a guest?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By all means.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Webster shook hands with the trio and departed for his hotel. For the
      first time in many years he was heavy of heart, crushed. &ldquo;Neddy
      Jerome was right,&rdquo; he soliloquized. &ldquo;This is the last place on
      earth for me to have come to. I've made Neddy sore on me, and he's
      lost patience and put another man in the job he promised me; I've
      raised Billy's hopes sky-high and had to bet forty thousand dollars
      to keep them there; I've been fool enough to fall in love with my
      friend's fiancée; I'm a human cat's-paw, and the finest
      thing I can do now is to go out next Sunday morning with that machine-gun
      company from Leber's warehouse and get killed. And I would, too, in
      a holy second, if killing a dozen of these spiggoties were part of a
      mining engineer's business. I just don't belong in this
      quarrel and I cannot kill for pleasure or profit. All I get out of this
      deal is gratitude and empty honour, where I dreamed of love and a home in
      my old age. John Stuart Webster, the family friend! Well, after all, it
      isn't every old sour-dough that has an opportunity to be a
      liberator, and even if I have lost Dolores, I have this melancholy
      satisfaction: I have a rattling good chance of getting that scrubby
      American consul.&rdquo;

      morning Webster informed Dolores fully of his interview with her brother
      and his confrères the night before, concealing from her only the fact that
      he was financing the revolution and his reasons for financing it. He was
      still depressed, and Dolores, observing his mood, forbore to intrude upon
      it. Intuitively she realized that when a man is worried and harassed by
      matters he cannot or dares hot divulge, he dislikes being talked to, but
      prefers to be alone and wrestle with them in silence. Accordingly she
      claimed the prerogative of her sex&mdash;a slight headache&mdash;and
      retreated to her room, In the privacy of which she was suddenly very much
      surprised to find herself weeping softly because John Stuart Webster was
      unhappy and didn't deserve to be.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was impossible, however, for Webster long to remain impervious to the
      note of ridiculousness underlying the forthcoming tragic events. Here was
      a little two-by-four poverty-stricken hot-bed of ignorance and intrigue
      calling itself a republic, a little stretch of country no larger than a
      couple of big western counties, about to indulge in the national pastime
      of civil war and unable to do it except by grace of an humble citizen of a
      sister republic!
    </p>
    <p>
      Five thousand ignorant, ill-equipped, ill-drilled semi-brigands calling
      themselves soldiers, entrusted with the task of enabling one of their
      number to ride, horse and dog, over a million people!
    </p>
    <p>
      How farcical! No wonder Ricardo, with his northern viewpoint, approached
      his patriotic task with gayety, almost with contempt. And when Webster
      recalled that the about-to-be-born provisional government had casually
      borrowed from him the sum of forty thousand dollars in order to turn the
      trick&mdash;borrowing it, forsooth, in much the same spirit as a commuter
      boarding his train without the necessary fare hails a neighbour and
      borrows ten cents&mdash;his natural optimism asserted itself and he
      chuckled as in fancy he heard himself telling the story to Neddy Jerome
      and being branded a liar for his pains.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I've had one comfort ever since I first saw that girl,&rdquo;
      he reflected philosophically. &ldquo;While I've never been so
      unhappy in all my life before, or had to tear my soul out by the roots so
      often, things have been coming my way so fast from other directions that I
      haven't had much opportunity to dwell on the matter. And for these
      compensating offsets, good Lord, I thank thee.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He was John Stuart Webster again when Dolores saw him next; during the
      succeeding days his mood of cheerfulness and devil-may-care indifference
      never left him. And throughout that period of marking time Dolores was
      much in his society, a condition which he told himself was not to his
      liking but which, nevertheless, he could not obviate without seeming
      indifferent to her happiness. And to permit his friend's fiancee to
      languish in loneliness and heart-break did not appear to John Stuart
      Webster as the part of a true friend or a courtly gentleman&mdash;and he
      remembered that she had once called him that.
    </p>
    <p>
      They rode together in the cool of the morning; they drove together on the
      Malecon in the cool of the evening; chaperoned by Don Juan Cafetéro and a
      grinning Sobrantean, they went shark-fishing in Leber's launch; they
      played dominoes together; they discussed, throughout the long, lazy, quiet
      afternoons, when the remainder of their world retired for the siesta,
      books, art, men, women, and things.
    </p>
    <p>
      And not once, throughout those two weeks of camaraderie, did the
      heart-racked Webster forget for a single instant that he was the new
      friend, destined to become the old friend; never, to the girl's
      watchful eyes, did he betray the slightest disposition to establish their
      friendly relations on a closer basis.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus did the arrival of The Day find them. Toward sunset they rode out
      together along the bay shore and noted far out to sea the smear of smoke
      that marked the approach of La Estrellita&mdash;on schedule time. As they
      jogged homeward in the dusk, her red and green side-lights were visible as
      she crept into the harbour; above the sobbing murmur of the Caribbean
      wavelets they heard the scream of her winches and the rattle of chain as
      her anchor bit the bottom.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You will go aboard her to-night,&rdquo; Webster said very quietly
      to Dolores.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shall go aboard with you. I have arranged with Don Juan for him
      to stay ashore and to come out in Leber's launch with the first
      reliable news of the conflict. If Ricardo wins the city, he wins the
      revolution, and you and I will then go ashore&mdash;to dine with him in
      the palace. If he loses the city, he loses the revolution, and we will
      both do well to remain aboard <i>La Estrellita</i>.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And in that event, what will become of my brother?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do not know; I forgot to ask him, but if he survives, I imagine
      he'll have sense enough to know he's whipped and will retreat
      on San Bruno, fighting a rear-guard action, embark aboard the steamer that
      brought his men there, and escape.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But he has so few men,&rdquo; she quavered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Two hundred of them are white soldiers of fortune&mdash;and you
      must remember how Walker manhandled Nicaragua with that number of men.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm worried about Mother Jenks.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have asked Mother Jenks to dine with us at seven-thirty this
      evening, and have ordered a carriage to call for her. When she comes I'll
      tell her everything; then, if she wishes to stay ashore, let her. She's
      been through more than one such fracas and doesn't mind them at all,
      I dare say.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      And in this Webster was right. Mother Jenks listened in profound silence,
      nodding her approval, as Webster related to her the story of the advent in
      the country of Ricardo Ruey and his plans, but without revealing the
      identity of Andrew Bowers.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the conclusion of his recital the old publican merely said: &ldquo;Gor'
      bli' me!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      After a silence she added: &ldquo;My sainted 'Enery used to s'y
      the proper hodds for a white man in a bally row o' this nature was
      forty to one. 'The spiggoty,' says 'e, shoots from
      'is 'ip, but the wisitin' brother's spent 'is
      'prenticeship at the butts some-w'ere or other an'
      'as bloomin' well learned to sight an' 'old his
      breath 'arf in an' 'arf out when 'e pulls. Gor',
      but how my sainted 'Enery would henjoy bein' 'ere this
      night to 'elp with the guns.&rdquo; She sighed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How about a little bottle of wine to drink peace to your sainted
      Henry and luck to The Cause?&rdquo; Webster suggested.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's wot I calls talkin',&rdquo; Mother Jenks
      responded promptly, and Webster, gazing reflectively at the old lady's
      beard, wondered why she had not been born a man.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dolores, fearful for her benefactor's safety, urged Mother Jenks to
      accompany them out aboard <i>La Estrellita</i>, but the old dame
      indignantly refused, and when pressed for a reason gave it with the utmost
      frankness: &ldquo;They'll be tykin' Sarros, an' when
      they tyke 'im they'll back him ag'in the same wall he
      backed my sainted 'Enery and your father against, my dear. I've
      a notion that your father's son 'll let Mrs. Colonel 'Enery
      Jenks come to the party.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      At ten o'clock Webster accompanied Mother Jenks home in the
      carriage, which he dismissed at El Buen Amigo&mdash;with instructions to
      return to the hotel while he continued afoot down the Calle San Rosario to
      the bay, where Leber's huge corrugated-iron warehouse loomed darkly
      above high-water mark. If there was light within, it was not visible, but
      Webster, pausing and listening at one corner of the great structure, could
      hear the confused murmur of many voices, with an occasional hearty oath in
      English rising above the murmur.
    </p>
    <p>
      He slipped along in the deep shadow of the warehouse wall and out on the
      end of the little dock, where he satisfied himself that Leber's
      launch was at its moorings; then he went back to the warehouse and
      whistled softly, whereupon a man crawled out from under the structure and
      approached him. It was Don Juan Cafetéro.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They're all inside,&rdquo; he whispered and laid finger on
      lip. &ldquo;A lad came down at eight o'clock, took Leber's
      launch an' wint out to the steamer afther thim. They got in half an
      hour ago, an' divil a sowl the wiser save meself.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank you, John. Now that I know the coast is clear and the launch
      ready, I'll go back to the hotel for Miss Ruey.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very well, sor,&rdquo; Don Juan replied, and crawled back under the
      warehouse.
    </p>
    <p>
      Half an hour later the sound of hoofbeats warned him of the approach of
      Webster and Dolores in a carriage, and he came forth, loaded in the launch
      such baggage as they had been enabled to bring, and held the gunwale of
      the boat while his passengers stepped aboard.
    </p>
    <p>
      While Don Juan cast off the painter, Webster primed the motor and turned
      it over; with a snort it started, and under Webster's guidance the
      launch backed swiftly out into the bay, where Don Juan lighted the
      side-lights and riding-light, and loafed off into the darkness.
    </p>
    <p>
      About a half a mile off shore Webster throttled down the motor until the
      launch barely made steerage way. &ldquo;It would never do to go aboard the
      steamer <i>before</i> the fracas started ashore,&rdquo; he explained to
      Dolores. &ldquo;That would indicate a guilty knowledge of coming events,
      and in the event of disaster to the rebel arms it is just possible Senor
      Sarros might have pull enough, if he hears of our flight six hours in
      advance of hostilities, to take us off the steamer and ask us to explain.
      So we'll just cruise slowly around and listen; the attack will come
      just before dawn; then shortly thereafter we can scurry out to the steamer
      and be welcomed aboard for the sake of the news we bring.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      She did not answer, and Webster knew her thoughts were out where the
      arc-lights on the outskirts of Buenaventura met the open country&mdash;out
      where the brother she could scarcely remember and whom, until a month
      previous, she had believed dead, would shortly muster his not too numerous
      followers.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the darkness Webster could hear the click of her beads as she prayed;
      on the turtle deck forward.
    </p>
    <p>
      Don Juan Cafetéro sprawled, thinking perchance of his unlovely past and
      wondering what effect the events shortly to transpire ashore would have on
      his future. He wished Webster would relent and offer him a drink some time
      within the next twenty-four hours. In times of excitement like the present
      a man needs a drop to brace him up.
    </p>
    <p>
      Five times the launch slipped lazily down the harbour along the straggling
      two mile water-front; five times it loafed back. The moon, which was in
      the first quarter, sank. For the hundredth time Don Juan Cafetéro chanted
      dolorously &ldquo;The Death of Sarsfield&rdquo; and the tuneful glories of
      the late O'Donnel Abu&mdash;and then to Webster's alert ear
      there floated across the still waters the sound of a gentle purring&mdash;the
      music of an auto-truck. He set the launch in toward Leber's little
      dock, and presently they saw the door of Leber's warehouse open. Men
      with lanterns streamed forth, lighting the way for others who bore between
      them heavy burdens.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They're emplacing the machine guns in the motor-truck,&rdquo;
      he whispered to Dolores. &ldquo;We will not have to wait long now. It's
      nearly four o'clock.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Again they backed out into the bay until they could see far out over the
      sleeping city to the hills beyond in the west. Presently along the side of
      those hills the headlight of a locomotive crept, dropping swiftly down
      grade until it disappeared in the lowlands.
    </p>
    <p>
      A half-hour passed; then to the south of the city a rocket flared skyward;
      almost instantly another flared from the west, followed presently by a
      murmur, scarcely audible, as of a muffled snare drum, punctuated presently
      by a louder, sharper, insistent <i>puck-puch-puch-puch</i> that, had
      Webster but known it, was the bark of a Maxim-Vickers rapid-fire gun
      throwing a stream of shells into the cantonments of the government troops
      on the fringe of the city.
    </p>
    <p>
      Webster's pulse quickened. He was possessed of that feeling which
      actuates a small boy to follow the fire-engines. &ldquo;There goes the
      'tillery to the south, sor,&rdquo; Don Juan called, and even as he
      spoke, a shell burst gloriously over the government palace, the white
      walls of which were already looming over the remainder of the city, now
      faintly visible in the approaching dawn.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That was to awaken our friend Sarros,&rdquo; Webster cried. &ldquo;I'll
      bet a buffalo nickel that woke the old horsethief up. There's
      another&mdash;and another.&rdquo; The uproar swelled, the noise gradually
      drifting around the city from west to south, forming, seemingly, a
      semicircle of sound. &ldquo;The government troops are up and doing now,&rdquo;
      Webster observed, and speeded up his motor. &ldquo;I think it high time we
      played the part of frightened refugees. When that machine-gun company with
      its infantry escort starts up through the city from Leber's
      warehouse it may encounter early opposition&mdash;and I've heard
      that Mauser bullets kill at three miles. Some strays may drop out here in
      the bay.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He speeded the launch toward <i>La Estrellita</i>, and as the craft
      scraped in alongside the great steamer's companion landing, her
      skipper ran down the ladder to greet them and inquire eagerly of the trend
      of events ashore.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We left in a hurry the instant it started,&rdquo; Webster
      explained. &ldquo;As Americans, we didn't figure we had any interest
      in that scrap, either way.&rdquo; He handed Dolores out on the landing
      stage, tossed their baggage after her and followed; Don Juan took the
      wheel, and the launch slid out and left them there.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the head of the companion ladder Webster paused and turned for another
      look at Buenaventura. To the west three great fires now threw a lurid
      light skyward, mocking an equally lurid light to the east, that marked the
      approach of daylight. He smiled. &ldquo;Those are the cantonment barracks
      burning,&rdquo; he whispered to Dolores. &ldquo;Ricardo is keeping his
      word. He's driving the rats back into their own holes.&rdquo;
    </p>

      CHAPTER XXIV
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">T</span>HE weeks of clean
      living, of abstention from his wonted daily alcoholic ration, had inspired
      in Don Juan Cafetéro a revival of his all but defunct interest in life;
      conversely, in these stirring times, he was sensible of an equally acute
      interest in Sobrantean politics, for he was Irish; and flabby indeed is
      that son of the Green Little Isle who, wherever he may be, declines to
      take a hand in any public argument. For the love of politics, like the
      love of home, is never dead in the Irish. It is instinct with them&mdash;the
      heritage, perhaps, of centuries of oppression and suppression, which
      nurtures rather than stifles the yearning for place and power. Now as Don
      Juan turned Leber's launch shoreward and kicked the motor wide open,
      he, too, descried against the dawn the glare of the burning cantonments
      west of the city, and at the sight his pulse beat high with the lust of
      battle, the longing to be in at the death in this struggle, where the
      hopes and aspirations of those he loved were at stake.
    </p>
    <p>
      Two months previously a revolution would have been a matter of extreme
      indifference to Don Juan; he would have reflected that it was merely the
      outs trying to get in, and that if they succeeded, the sole benefit to the
      general public would be the privilege of paying the bill. It was all very
      well, perhaps, to appoint a new <i>jefe politico</i>, if only for the sake
      of diversion, but new or old they &ldquo;jugged&rdquo; or booted Don Juan
      Cafetéro impartially from time to time; the lowliest peon could shoulder
      the derelict off the narrow sidewalks, while the policeman on the beat
      looked on and grinned. Consequently, drunk or sober, Don Juan would not
      have fought with or for a Sobrantean, since he knew from experience that
      either line of activity was certain to prove unprofitable. To-day,
      however, in the knowledge that he had an opportunity to fight beside white
      men and perchance even up some old scores with the <i>Guardia Civil</i>,
      it occurred suddenly to Don Juan that it would be a brave and virtuous act
      to cast his lot with the Ruey forces. He was a being reorganized and
      rebuilt, and it behooved him to do something to demonstrate his manhood.
    </p>
    <p>
      Don Juan knew, of course, that should the rebels lose and he be captured,
      he would be executed; yet this contingency seemed a far-fetched one, in
      view of the fact that he had John Stuart Webster at his back, ready to
      finance his escape from the city. Also Don Juan had had an opportunity, in
      the hills above San Miguel de Padua, for a critical study of Ricardo Ruey
      and had come to the conclusion that at last a real man had come to
      liberate Sobrante; further, Don Juan had had ocular evidence that John
      Stuart Webster was connected with the revolution, for had he not smuggled
      Ruey into the country? It was something to be the right-hand man of the
      president of a rich little country like Sobrante; it was also something to
      be as close to that right-hand man as Don Juan was to his master, Webster;
      consequently self-interest and his sporting code whispered to Don Juan
      that it behooved him to demonstrate his loyalty with every means at his
      command, even unto his heart's blood.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who knows,&rdquo; he cogitated as the launch bore him swiftly
      shoreward, &ldquo;but what I'll acquit meself with honour and get a
      fine job undher the new administhration? 'Tis the masther's
      fight, I'm thinkin'; then, be the same token, 'tis John
      Joseph Cafferty's, win, lose or dhraw; an' may the divil damn
      me if I fail him afther what he's done for me. Sure, if Gineral Ruey
      wins, a crook av the masther's finger will make me <i>jefe 'politico</i>.
      An' if he does&mdash;hoo-roo! Hoo-ray!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      With his imagination still running riot, Don Juan made the launch fast to
      the little dock, down which, he ran straight for the warehouse, where the
      Ruey mercenaries were still congregated, busily wiping the factory-grease
      from the weapons which had just been distributed to them from the
      packing-cases. A sharp voice halted him, he paused, panting, to find
      himself looking down the long blue barrel of a service pistol.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who are you, and what are you doing here?&rdquo; the man behind the
      weapon demanded brusquely.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm Private John J. Cafferty, the latest recruit to the Ruey
      army,&rdquo; Don Juan answered composedly. &ldquo;Who did ye think I was?
      Private secreth'ry to that divil Sarros? Man, dear, lower that gun
      av yours, for God knows I'm nervous enough as it is. Have ye
      somethin' ye could give me to fight wit,' avic?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The man who had challenged him&mdash;a lank, swarthy individual from the
      Mexican border&mdash;looked him over with twinkling eyes. &ldquo;You'll
      do, Cafferty, old-timer,&rdquo; he drawled, &ldquo;and if you don't,
      you'll wish you had. There's a man for every rifle just now,
      but I wouldn't be surprised if there'd be a right smart more
      rifles than men before a great while. Help yourself to the gun o'
      the first man that goes down; in the meantime, hop into that there truck
      and keep the cartridge belt for the machine guns full up. You're
      just in time.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Without further ado Don Juan climbed into the truck. A little citadel of
      sheet steel had been built around the driver's seat, with a narrow
      slit in front through which the latter peered out. The body of the truck
      had been boxed in with the same material and housed two machine guns,
      emplaced, and a crew of half a dozen men crouched on the floor, busily
      engaged in loading the belts. Four motor bicycles, with sturdy, specially
      built side-cars attached, and a machine gun in each side-car, were waiting
      near by, together with a half-dozen country carts loaded with ammunition
      cases and drawn by horses.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How soon do we start?&rdquo; Don Juan demanded anxiously, as he
      crowded in beside one of his newfound comrades.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I believe,&rdquo; this individual replied in the unmistakable
      accents of an Oxford man, &ldquo;that the plan is to wait until five o'clock;
      by that time all the government troops that can be spared from the arsenal
      and palace will have been dispatched to the fighting now taking place west
      of the city. Naturally, the government forces aren't anticipating an
      attack from the rear, and so they will, in all probability, weaken their
      base. I believe that eases our task; certainly it will save us many men.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Don Juan nodded his entire approval to this shrewd plan of campaign and
      fell to stuffing cartridges in the web belting, the while he whistled
      softly, unmusically, and with puffing, hissing sounds between his snaggle
      teeth, until a Sobrantean gentleman (it was Doctor Pacheco) came out of
      the warehouse and gave the order to proceed.
    </p>
    <p>
      They moved out silently, the Sobrantean rebels falling into line behind
      the auto-truck, the motorcycle battery, and the transport-carts, all of
      which were in charge of the machine gun company. They marched along the
      water-front for four blocks and then turned up a side street, which
      happened to be the Calle de Concordia, thus enabling Mother Jenks, who was
      peering from the doorway of El Buen Amigo, to see them coming.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hah!&rdquo; she muttered. &ldquo;'Enery, they're cornin'.
      The worm is turnin', 'Enery; fifteen years you've wyted
      for vengeance, my love, but to-d'y you'll get it.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      She waddled out into the street and held up her hand in a gesture as
      authoritative and imperious as that of a traffic officer. &ldquo;Batter-r-ry
      'alt!&rdquo; she croaked. She had heard the late 'Enery give
      that command often enough to have acquired the exact inflection necessary
      to make an impression upon men accustomed to obeying such a command
      whenever given. Instinctively the column slowed up; some of the Foreign
      Legion, old coast-artillerists, no doubt, came to a halt with promptness
      and precision; all stared at Mother Jenks.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ow about 'arf a dozen cases o' good brandy for the
      wounded?&rdquo; Mother Jenks suggested. &ldquo;An' 'ow about a
      bally old woman for a Red Cross nurse?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You're on, ma'am,&rdquo; the foreign leader replied
      promptly, and translated the old lady's suggestion to Doctor
      Pacheco, who accepted gracefully and thanked Mother Jenks in purest
      Castilian. So a detail of six men was told off to carry the six cases of
      brandy out of El Buen Amigo and load them on the ammunition carts; then
      Mother Jenks crawled up into the armoured truck with the machine-gun crew,
      and the column once more took up its line of rapid march.
    </p>
    <p>
      The objective of this unsuspected force within the city was, as Ricardo
      Ruey shrewdly suspected it might be, poorly garrisoned. Usually a force of
      fully five hundred men was stationed at the national arsenal, but the
      sharp, savage attack from the west, so sudden and unexpected, had thrown
      Sarros into a panic and left him no time to plan his defence carefully.
      His first thought had been to send all his available forces to support the
      troops bearing the brunt of the rebel attack, and it was tremendously
      important that this should be done very promptly, in view of the lack of
      information concerning the numerical force of the enemy; consequently he
      had reduced the arsenal force to one hundred men and retained only his
      favorite troop of the Guards and one company of the Fifteenth Infantry to
      protect the palace.
    </p>
    <p>
      Acting under hastily given telephonic orders, the commanding officer at
      the cantonment barracks had detailed a few hundred men to fight a
      rear-guard action while the main army fell back in good order behind a
      railway embankment which swept in a wide arc around the city and offered
      an excellent substitute for breastworks. This position had scarcely been
      attained before the furious advance of the rebels drove in the rear guard,
      and pending the capture of the arsenal, Ricardo realized his operations
      were at an <i>impasse</i>. Promptly he dug himself in, and the battle
      developed into a brisk affair of give and take, involving meagre losses to
      both factions but an appalling wastage of ammunition.
    </p>
    <p>
      The arsenal, a large, modern concrete building with tremendously thick
      walls reinforced by steel, would have offered fairly good resistance to
      the average field battery. Surrounding it on all four sides was a
      reinforced concrete wall thirty feet high, with machine-gun bastions at
      each corner and a platform along the wall, inside and twenty-five feet
      from the ground, which afforded foot room for infantry which could use the
      top five feet of the wall for protection while firing over it. There was
      but one entrance, a heavy, barred steel gate which was always kept locked
      when it was not necessary to have it opened for ingress or egress. Given
      warning of an attack and with sufficient time to prepare for it, one
      hundred of the right sort of fighting men could withstand an indefinite
      siege by a force not provided with artillery heavier than an ordinary
      field gun. With a full realization of this, therefore, Ricardo and his
      confrères had designed to accomplish by strategy that which could not be
      done by the limited forces at their command.
    </p>
    <p>
      The tread of marching men, the purr of the motorcycles and the armoured
      truck, during the progress of the invaders up the Calle de Concordia,
      aroused the dwellers in that thoroughfare. Those who appeared in their'
      doorways, however, as promptly disappeared upon recognizing this
      indubitable evidence of local disturbance. As the column approached the
      neighbourhood of the arsenal, three detachments broke away from the main
      body and disappeared down side streets, to turn at right angles later and
      march parallel with the main command. Each of these detachments was
      accompanied by one unit of the motorcycle-mounted machine-gun battery with
      its white crew; two blocks beyond the arsenal square each detachment
      leader so disposed his men as to offer spirited resistance to any sortie
      that might be made by the troops from the palace in the hope of driving
      off the attackers of the arsenal.
    </p>
    <p>
      Having thus provided for protection during its operations, the main body
      nominally under Doctor Pacheco but in reality commanded by the chief of
      the machine-gun company, proceeded to operate. With the utmost assurance
      in the world the armoured truck rolled down the street to the arsenal
      entrance, swung in and pointed its impudent nose straight at the iron bars
      while the hidden chauffeur called loudly and profanely in Spanish upon the
      sentry to open the gate and let him in&mdash;that there was necessity for
      great hurry, since he had been sent down from the palace by the <i>présidente</i>
      himself, for machine guns to equip this armoured motor-car. The sentry
      immediately called the officer of the guard, who peered out, observed
      nothing but the motor-truck, which seemed far from dangerous, and without
      further ado inserted a huge key in the lock and turned the bolt. The
      sentry swung the double gates ajar, and with a prolonged and raucous toot
      of its horn the big car loafed in. The sentry closed the gate again, while
      the officer stepped up to turn the key in the lock. Instead, he died with
      half a dozen pistol bullets through his body, while the sentry sprawled
      beside him.
    </p>
    <p>
      The prolonged toot of the motor-horn had been the signal agreed upon to
      apprise the detachment waiting in a secluded back street that the truck
      was inside the arsenal wall. With a yell they swept out of the side street
      and down on the gate, through which they poured into the arsenal grounds.
      At sound of the first shot at the gate, the <i>comandante</i> of the
      garrison, which had been drawn up in double rank for reveille roll call,
      realized he was attacked and that swift measures were necessary.
      Fortunately for him, his men were standing at attention at the time,
      preparatory to receiving from him one of those ante-battle exhortations so
      dear to the Latin soul.
    </p>
    <p>
      A sharp command, and the little garrison had fixed bayonets; another
      command, and they were in line of squads; before the auto-truck could be
      swung sideways to permit a machine gun to play on the Sobranteans in close
      formation, the latter had thrown out a skirmish fine and were charging;
      while from the guardhouse window, just inside the gate, a volley, poured
      into the unprotected rear of the truck following its passage through the
      gate, did deadly execution. The driver, a bullet through his back, sagged
      forward into his steel-clad citadel; both machine-gun operators were
      wounded, and the truck was stalled. The situation was desperate.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm a gone goose,&rdquo; mourned Don Juan Cafetéro, and he
      leaped from the shambles to the ground, with some hazy notion of making
      his escape through the gate. He was too late. Two men, riding tandem on a
      motorcycle with a machine gun in the specially constructed side-car,
      appeared in the entrance and leaped off; almost before Don Juan had time
      to dodge behind the motor-truck to escape possible wild bullets, the
      machine gun was sweeping the oncoming skirmish line. Don Juan cheered as
      man after man of the garrison pitched on his face, for the odds were
      rapidly being evened now, greatly to the pleasure of the men charging
      through the gate to support the machine gun. Out into the arsenal yard
      they swept, forcing the machine-gun crew to cease firing because of the
      danger of killing their own men; with a shock bayonet met bayonet in the
      centre of the yard, and the issue was up for prompt and final decision.
    </p>
    <p>
      Don Juan's Hibernian blood thrilled; he cast about for a weapon in
      this emergency, and his glance rested on the body of the dead officer
      beside the gate. To possess himself of the latter's heavy &ldquo;cut-and-thrust&rdquo;
      sword was the work of seconds, and with a royal good will Don Juan
      launched himself into the heart of the scrimmage. He had a hazy impression
      that he was striking and stabbing, that others were striking and stabbing
      at him, that men crowded and breathed and pressed and swore and grunted
      around him, that the fighting-room was no better than it might have been
      but was rapidly improving. Then the gory fog lifted, and Doctor Pacheco
      had Don Juan by the hand; they stood together in the arsenal entrance, and
      the little Doctor was explaining to the war-mad Don Juan that all was over
      in so far as the arsenal was concerned&mdash;the survivors of the garrison
      having surrendered&mdash;that now, having the opportunity, he, Doctor
      Pacheco, desired to thank Don Juan Cafetéro for his life. Don Juan looked
      at him amazedly, for he hadn't the slightest idea what the Doctor
      was talking about. He spat, gazed around at the litter of corpses on the
      arsenal lawn, and nodded his red head approvingly.
    </p>
    <p>
      In an incredibly short space of time the news that the arsenal had been
      captured and that Sarros was besieged in the palace spread through the
      city. The sight of the red banner of revolution floating over the arsenal
      for the first time in fifteen years brought hundreds of willing recruits
      to the rebel ranks, as Ricardo Ruey had anticipated; these were quickly
      supplied with arms and ammunition; by ten o'clock a battalion had
      been formed and sent off, together with the machine-gun company, to
      connect with the San Bruno contingent advancing from the south to turn the
      flank of the government troops, while the equipping of an additional
      battalion proceeded within the arsenal. As fast as the new levies were
      armed, they were hurried off to reinforce the handful of white men who
      had, after clearing the arsenal, advanced on the palace and now, with
      machine guns from the arsenal commanding all avenues of escape from the
      trap wherein Sarros found himself, were calmly awaiting developments,
      merely keeping an eye open for snipers.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus the forenoon passed away. By one o'clock Don Juan Cafetéro&mdash;who
      in the absence of close-range fighting had elected himself ordnance
      sergeant&mdash;passed out the last rifle and ammunition. He was red with
      slaughter, slippery with gun-grease, dripping with perspiration and filthy
      with dust and dirt. &ldquo;Begorra,&rdquo; he declared, &ldquo;a cowld
      bottle av beer would go fine now.&rdquo; Then, recalling his limitations,
      he sighed and put the thought from him. It revived in him, however, for
      the first time since he had left the steamer, a memory of John Stuart
      Webster, and his promise to the latter to report on the progress of the
      war. So Don Juan sought Doctor Pacheco in his headquarters and learned
      that a signal-man, heliographing from the roof of the arsenal, had been in
      communication with General Ruey, who reported the situation well in hand,
      with no doubt of an overwhelming victory before the day should be over.
      This and sundry other bits of information Don Juan gleaned and then
      deserted the Sobrantean revolutionary army quite as casually as he had
      joined it, to make his precarious way down the Calle San Rosario to the
      bay.

      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">T</span>HROUGHOUT the
      forenoon Webster and Dolores, from the deck of the steamer, watched the
      city. Numerous fires covered it with a pall of smoke from beneath which
      came the steady crackle of machine-gun fire, mingled with the insistent
      crash of the field batteries which seemingly had moved up closer to their
      target.

    </h5>
    <p>
      By ten o'clock the sounds of battle had swelled to a deeper,
      steadier roar, and refugees arriving brought various and fragmentary
      stories of the fighting. From this hodge-podge of misinformation, however,
      Webster decided that Ricardo's troops were forcing the issue with
      vim and determination, and since the most furious fighting was now well in
      toward the heart of the city, it seemed reasonable to presume the struggle
      was for possession of the arsenal and palace.
    </p>
    <p>
      At noon the deep diapason of conflict began to slacken; by one o'clock
      it had dwindled considerably, and at two o'clock Webster, gazing
      anxiously cityward, observed Leber's launch coming rapidly out from
      shore. At the wheel stood Don Juan Cafetéro; as the launch shot in under
      the vessel's side he looked up, searching for Webster's face
      among the curious throng that lined the rail.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Faugh-a-ballagh!&rdquo; he shrieked. &ldquo;We've got the
      divils cornered now. 'Twill be over two hours hince.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who has won?&rdquo; a voice called, and another, evidently a
      humourist and a shrewd judge of human nature, replied: &ldquo;Why ask
      foolish questions? The rebels, of course. That fellow's Irish and
      the Irish are born rebels. Look at the scoundrel. He's black with
      gun-grease and burned powder where he isn't red with blood. The
      butcher!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Don Juan tied up the launch at the gangway and leaped up the ladder, three
      steps at a time. &ldquo;Glory be to God,&rdquo; he panted and hurled
      himself into Webster's arms. &ldquo;I was in it! I was. I got back
      in time to catch up wit' the lads at the warehouse an' they
      were the fine, fightin' divils, I'll gamble you. Och, 'twas
      a grrand bit av a fight&mdash;whilst it lasted. They put me in the
      motor-thruck, loadin' the belts wit' ca'tridges as fast
      as the gunners imptied thim, but faith they couldn't keep me there.
      I got into the heart av the scrimmage in the yard av the arsenal an'
      faith 'twas well for that little Docthor Pacheco I did. 'Twas
      wurrk to me likin'. I'd a machete&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You bloodthirsty scoundrel!&rdquo; Webster shook the war-mad son of
      Erin. &ldquo;I told you not to mix in it, but to hang around on the fringe
      of the fight, and bring us early news. Suppose you'd been killed?
      Who would have come for us then? Didn't I tell you we had a dinner
      engagement in the palace?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Me on the fringes av a fight,&rdquo; sputtered Don Juan, amazed and
      outraged. &ldquo;Take shame for yerself, sor. There was niver the likes av
      me hung around the fringes av a fight, an' well ye know it.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm amazed that you even remembered your instructions,&rdquo;
      Webster rasped at him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sure, our division had cl'aned up nicely an' I had
      nothin' else to do, God bless ye. They were besiegin' the
      palace whin I left, an' small chance av takin' it for a couple
      av hours; what fightin' there was on the outside was shtreet shootin'&mdash;an'
      not to me likin'.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is it quite safe to bring Miss Ruey ashore, John?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Tis safe enough at the Hotel Mateo. We have the city for
      half a mile beyant, in the rear av them&mdash;an' they're not
      fightin' to get to the bay. The Guards an' some av the
      Fifteenth Infanthry regimint are in the palace an' the <i>cuartel</i>
      close by, an' thim that we failed to get in the arsenal have j'ined
      thim. But the bulk av the Sarros army is thryin' to break t'rough
      to the south an' west, to get to the hills. D'ye mind the spur
      thrack that runs in a semi-cirrcle around the city? Well, thin, the rebels
      are behint the embankmint, takin' it aisy. Have no worry, sor. Whin
      we've took the palace we'll move on an' dhrive the
      vagàbones from behint up to that railroad embankmint, where <i>Gineral
      Ruey</i> can bid them the time av day.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Webster turned to Dolores. &ldquo;Do you wish to go ashore?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      She nodded, her flashing eyes bent in admiration upon the gory, grimy Don
      Juan Cafetéro, for she was half Irish, and in that amazing meeting she
      knew the outcast for one of her blood. &ldquo;I think my brother will
      sleep in his father's old room to-night,&rdquo; she murmured softly.
      &ldquo;And I would sleep in mine.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      They followed Don Juan down the gangway to the launch and sped back to the
      city. The door of Leber's warehouse stood wide open; within was a
      litter of greasy rags and broken packing cases, with Leber, quite
      mystified, sitting on a keg of nails and staring curiously at it all.
    </p>
    <p>
      Guided by Don Juan Cafetéro, Webster and Dolores passed on up the Calle
      San Rosario. Occasionally a bullet, fired two or three miles to the west,
      droned lazily overhead or dropped with a sharp metallic sound on the
      corrugated-iron roofs of a building. At the hotel the proprietor alone was
      in evidence, seated behind the desk smoking in profound indifference.
    </p>
    <p>
      In response to Webster's eager inquiries for the latest news from
      the front, the placid fellow shrugged and murmured: &ldquo;<i>Quien sabe?</i>&rdquo;
      Evidently for him such stirring scenes had long since lost their novelty;
      the bloom was off the peach, as it were.
    </p>
    <p>
      Webster went upstairs and helped himself to another automatic and several
      spare clips of shells which he had left in his trunk. On his return to the
      lobby, Dolores saw what a very near sighted person, indeed, would have
      seen&mdash;to wit: that he was not pleased to remain in the hotel and with
      the spirit of adventure strong within him was desirous of progressing
      still farther toward the firing, in the hope of eliciting some favourable
      news as to the progress of the fight. She realized, however, that he would
      do his duty and remain with her in the hotel; so she said gaily:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Suppose we walk out a little farther, Caliph. Many of the side
      streets will be as safe and peaceful as one could desire, and if warfare
      should develop in our vicinity we can step into some house.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do not like to have you run the slightest risk&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
      he began, but she pooh-poohed him into silence, took him by the arm with a
      great air of camaraderie, and declared they should go forth to adventure&mdash;but
      cautiously.
    </p>
    <p>
      Webster glanced at Don Juan. &ldquo;We can go a half or three quarters av
      a mile out the Calle San Rosario, sor,&rdquo; the Irishman answered.
      &ldquo;After that 'twill not be a pleasant sight for the young leddy&mdash;an'
      there may be some shootin'. Squads av the governmint throops took
      refuge in the houses an' took to snipin'. 'Twill be
      shlow wurrk roundin' the last av thim up. Even afther the fight is
      over, there'll be scatterin' shootin' scrapes all av the
      night long, I'm thinkin'.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;At the slightest danger we'll turn back,&rdquo; Webster
      announced, and with Don Juan Cafetéro scouting the way a block in advance
      they progressed slowly toward the centre of the disturbance.
    </p>
    <p>
      Soon they passed a horse dead in the middle of the street; a little
      farther on one of the machine-gun company, a lank Texan, sat on the curb
      rolling a cigarette with his left hand. He had a bullet through his right
      shoulder and another through the calf of his left leg and had received no
      first aid attention; the flies were bothering him considerably and he was
      cursing softly and fluently, like the ex-mule-skinner he was.
    </p>
    <p>
      Farther on another white invader lay face down in the gutter; for him the
      fight had ended almost ere it had begun. In the next block half a dozen
      sandal-footed Sobranteans, in the blue and red-trimmed uniform of the <i>Guardia
      Civil</i>, lay spawled in uncouth attitudes, where the first blast of a
      machine gun had caught them as they rushed out of the police station to
      repel the advancing mercenaries.
    </p>
    <p>
      Seeing that the main street of the city would assume even a more grisly
      aspect the longer they followed it, Don Juan led Webster and Dolores a
      couple of blocks down a cross-street and turned out into the Calle de
      Hernandez, parallel to the Calle San Rosario. There had been no shooting
      in this street, apparently; as they proceeded not even a stray bullet
      whined down the silent calle.
    </p>
    <p>
      Four blocks from the government palace, however, they found the narrow
      sidewalks of this quiet street lined with wounded from both sides, with a
      doctor and half a dozen of Ricardo's hired fighters ministering to
      them; as they threaded their way between the recumbent figures they came
      upon Mother Jenks, brandy bottle and glass in hand, &ldquo;doing her bit.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hah! So here you are, my lamb,&rdquo; she greeted Dolores. &ldquo;Right-o.
      Just where yer ought to be, Gor' bless yer sweet face. Let these
      poor misfortunate lads see that the sister o' the new president ain't
      too proud to care for 'em. 'Ere, lass. 'Old up the
      'ead o' this young cockerel with the 'ole in 'is
      neck. 'Ere, lad. Tyke a brace now! 'Ere's some o'
      your own people, not a lot o' bloomin' yeller-bellies, come to
      put something else in yer neck&mdash;somethink that'll stimulate
      yer.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The &ldquo;young cockerel,&rdquo; a blond youth of scarce twenty summers,
      twisted his head and grinned up at Dolores as she knelt beside him to lift
      him up. &ldquo;Here, here, sister,&rdquo; he mumbled, &ldquo;you'll
      get that white dress dirty. Never mind me. It's just a flesh wound,
      only my neck has got stiff and I'm weak from loss of blood.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Mother Jenks winked at Webster as she set a glass of brandy to the
      stricken adventurer's lips. &ldquo;Give me a bit o' the white
      meat, as my sainted 'Enery used to s'y,&rdquo; she murmured
      comically.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dolores looked up at Webster. &ldquo;I'll stay here,&rdquo; she said
      simply. &ldquo;I've found a job helping Mother Jenks. You and Don
      Juan may run along if you wish. I know you're as curious as
      children.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      They were. It would have been impossible for any man with red corpuscles
      in his blood to harken to the shooting and shouts only three city blocks
      distant without yearning to see the fight itself.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'll return in fifteen minutes, at the latest,&rdquo; he
      promised her, and with Don Juan Cafetéro, who had helped himself to a
      rifle and bayonet from one of the wounded, he turned the corner into the
      next street and started back toward the Calie San Rosario, which they
      followed west through a block plentifully sprinkled with the dead of both
      factions.
    </p>
    <p>
      Don Juan led the way through an alley in the rear of the Catedral de la
      Santa Cruz to the door of the sacristy; as he placed his hand on the latch
      three rifle bullets struck around them, showering them with fragments of
      falling adobe.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There's a house party in the neighbourhood,&rdquo; yelled Don
      Juan and darted into the church, with Webster at his heels, just in time
      to escape another fusillade. They walked through the sacristy and passed
      through a door into the great cathedral, with its high, carved,
      Gothic-arched ceiling. Through the thick closed doors of the main
      entrance, lost in the dimness of space out in front, the sounds of the
      battle half a block away seemed very distant, indeed.
    </p>
    <p>
      They passed the altar and Don Juan genuflected and crossed himself
      reverently. &ldquo;I'll be afther makin' me confession,&rdquo;
      he whispered to Webster. &ldquo;Wait for me, sor.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He leaned his rifle against the altar railing, crossed the church and
      touched lightly on the shoulder a monk kneeling in prayer before the altar
      of the Virgin; the latter bent his head while Don Juan whispered; then he
      rose and both went into the confessional, while Webster found a bench
      along the wall and waited.
    </p>
    <p>
      Presently Don Juan came forth, knelt on the red-tiled floor and prayed&mdash;something,
      Webster suspected, he had not done for quite a while. And when he had
      finished his supplication and procured his rifle, Webster joined him, the
      monk unbolted the door and from the quiet of the house of God they passed
      out into the street and the tumult of hell.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I've been dost to death this day,&rdquo; Don Juan explained,
      &ldquo;an' the day is not done. Be the same token, 'tis long
      since I'd made me last confession; sure, until you picked me out av
      the mire, sor, 'tis little thought I had for the hereafter.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      They were standing on the steps of the cathedral as Don Juan spoke, and
      from their place they could see a dozen or more of Ricardo's hired
      fighters crouched under the shelter of the palace walls across the street.
      &ldquo;I think we'll be safer there,&rdquo; Webster cried, as a
      couple of bullets struck the stone steps at their feet and ricocheted
      against the cathedral door. &ldquo;That rifle of yours is making you a
      marked man, Don Juan.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      They ran across the street and joined the men under the palace wall.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What's this?&rdquo; Don Juan demanded briskly. &ldquo;Have ye
      not shmoked thim out yet?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Noddings doing,&rdquo; a young German answered. &ldquo;Der chief
      has sent word dot we shall not artillery use on der balace. Men all
      aroundt it we haf, mit a machine gun commanding each gate; most of der
      poys have chust moved out west in der rear of der government troops.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then,&rdquo; Don Juan declared with conviction, &ldquo;there'll
      be no fighting here to speak av, until later.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Der is blenty of choy hunting snipers, <i>mein freund</i>. Der
      houses hereabouts vos filled mit dem.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'll have no cat fights in mine,&rdquo; Don Juan retorted.
      &ldquo;Come wit' me, sor, an' we'll be in at the death
      out beyant at the railroad embankmint.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Too late,&rdquo; Webster answered, for on the instant to the west
      the crackle of rifle and machine-gun fire interluded with the staccato
      barks of a Maxim-Vickers broke out, swelling almost immediately to a
      steady outpouring of sound. &ldquo;We'll stay here where we're
      safe for the finals. When General Ruey has cleaned up out there he'll
      come here to take command.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      For half an hour the sounds of a brisk engagement to the west did not
      slacken; then with disconcerting suddenness the uproar died away fully 50
      per cent.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They're going in with the bayonet and machetes,&rdquo;
      somebody who knew remarked laconically. &ldquo;Wait and you'll hear
      the cheering.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      They waited fully ten minutes, but presently, as the firing gradually died
      away, they heard it, faint and indistinguishable at first, but gradually
      coming nearer. And presently the trapped men in the palace heard it, too.
      &ldquo;Viva Ruey! Viva! Viva Ruey!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All over but the shouting,&rdquo; Don Juan remarked disgustedly.
      &ldquo;The lads in the palace will surrindher now. Sure Gineral Ruey was
      right afther all. For why should he shoot holes in the house he's
      goin' to live in, an' where, be the same token, he gives a
      dinner party this night?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm glad the end is in sight,&rdquo; Webster replied. &ldquo;We
      have no interest in this revolution, John, and it isn't up to us to
      horn in on the play; yet if it went against the Ruey faction, I fear we'd
      be forced into active service in spite of ourselves. There is such a thing
      as fighting to save one's skin, you know.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Don Juan laughed pleasurably. &ldquo;What a shame we missed the row out
      beyant at the railroad em-bankmint,&rdquo; he declared.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wish you'd kept out of it, Don Juan. What business had you
      in the fight at the <i>cuartd?</i> Suppose you'd been killed?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Small loss!&rdquo; Don Juan retorted.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should have mourned you nevertheless, John.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Would you that same?&rdquo; Don Juan's buttermilk eyes
      lighted with affection and pleasure. &ldquo;Would it put a pang in the
      heart of you, sor, to see me stretched?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, it would, John. You're a wild, impulsive, lunatic,
      worthless Irishman, but there's a broad vein of pay-ore in you, and
      I want you to live until I can develop it. When Mr. Geary returns to
      operate the mine, he'll need a foreman he can trust.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And do you trust me, sor?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do indeed, John. By the way, you never gave me your word of
      honour to cut out red liquor for keeps. Up till to-day I've had to
      watch you&mdash;and I don't want to do that. It isn't
      dignified for either of us, and from to-day on you must be a man or a
      mouse. If you prove yourself a man, I want you in my business; if you
      prove yourself a mouse, somebody else may have you. How about you, John?
      The <i>cantinas</i> will be open to-night, and firewater will be free to
      the soldiers of the new republic. Must I watch you to-night?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Don Juan shook his reckless red head. &ldquo;I'll never let a drop
      of liquor cross my lips without your permission, sor,&rdquo; he promised
      simply. &ldquo;I am the man and you are the master.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We'll shake hands on that!&rdquo; After the western habit of
      validating all verbal agreements with a handshake, Webster thrust his hard
      hand out to his man, who took it in both of his and held it for half a
      minute. He wanted to speak, but couldn't; he could only bow his head
      as his eyes clouded with the tears of his appreciation. &ldquo;Ah, sor,&rdquo;
      he blurted presently, &ldquo;I'd die for ye an' welcome the
      chanst.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      A wild yell of alarm broke out in the next block, at the north gate of the
      palace; there was a sudden flurry of rifle fire and cries of &ldquo;Here
      they come! Stop them! Stop them! They're breaking out!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Without awaiting orders the hired fighters along the wall&mdash;some
      fifteen of them&mdash;leaped out into the street, forming a skirmish line,
      just as a troop of cavalry, with drawn sabres, swept around the corner and
      charged upon the devoted little line. &ldquo;Sarros must be thryin'
      to make his get-away,&rdquo; Don Juan Cafetéro remarked coolly, and
      emptied a saddle. &ldquo;They threw open the big palace gate, an'
      the Guards are clearin' a way for him to the bay.&rdquo; He emptied
      another saddle.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the meantime Ricardo's fire-eaters had not been idle. The instant
      the Guards turned into the street a deadly magazine fire had been opened
      on them. They had already suffered heavily winning through the gate and
      past the besiegers in front of it, but once they turned the corner into
      the next street they had the fire of but a handful of men to contend with.
      Nevertheless it was sufficiently deadly. Many of the horses in the front
      rank went down with their riders, forcing the maddened animals behind to
      clear their carcasses by leaping over them, which some did. Many, however,
      tripped and stumbled in their wild gallop, spilling their riders.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Stay by the wall, you madman,&rdquo; Webster ordered. &ldquo;There'll
      be enough left to ride down those men in the street and sabre them!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      And there were! They died to a man, and the sadly depleted troop of Guards
      galloped, on, leaving Don Juan and Webster unscathed on the sidewalk, the
      only two living men unhurt in that shambles.
    </p>
    <p>
      Not for long, however, did they have the street to themselves. Around the
      corner of the palace wall a limousine, with the curtains drawn, swung on
      two wheels, skidded, struck the carcass of a horse and turned over,
      catapulting the chauffeur into the middle of the street.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sarros!&rdquo; shrieked Don Juan and ran to the overturned vehicle.
      It was quite empty.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bully boy, Senor Sarros,&rdquo; Webster laughed. &ldquo;He's
      turned à pretty trick, hasn't he? Sent his Guards out to hack a
      pathway for an empty limousine! That means he's hoping to draw the
      watchers from the other gate!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      But Don Juan Cafetéro was not listening; he was running at top speed for
      the south gate of the palace grounds&mdash;and Webster followed.
    </p>
    <p>
      As they swung into the street upon which this south gate opened, Webster
      saw that it was deserted of all save the dead, for Sarros's clever
      ruse had worked well and had had the effect of arousing the curiosity of
      his enemies as to the cause of the uproar at the north gate, in
      consequence of which they had all scurried around the block to see what
      they could see, thus according Sarros the thing he desired most&mdash;a
      fighting chance and a half minute to get through the gate and headed for
      the steamship landing without interference.
    </p>
    <p>
      Webster and Don Juan came abreast the high, barred gate in the thick,
      twenty-foot masonry wall as the barrier swung back and a man, in civilian
      clothes, thundered through on a magnificent bay thoroughbred.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's him. Shtop the divil!&rdquo; screamed Don Juan.
      &ldquo;They'll do the decent thing be me if I take him alive.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      To Webster, who had acquired the art of snap shooting while killing time
      in many a lonely camp, the bay charger offered an easy mark. &ldquo;Hate
      to down that beautiful animal,&rdquo; he remarked&mdash;and pulled away.
    </p>
    <p>
      The horse leaped into the air and came down stifflegged; Sarros spurred it
      cruelly, and the gallant beast strove to gather itself into its stride,
      staggered and sank to its knees, as with a wild Irish yell Don Juan
      Cafetéro reached the dictator's side.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sarros drew a revolver, but before he could use it Don Juan tapped him
      smartly over the head with his rifle barrel, and the man toppled inertly
      to the ground beside his dying horse.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;More power to ye, sor,&rdquo; Don Juan called cheerily and turned
      to receive Webster's approval.
    </p>
    <p>
      What he saw paralyzed him for an instant. Webster was standing beside the
      gate, firing into a dozen of Sarros's soldiery who were pouring out
      of a house just across the street, where for an hour they had crouched
      unseen and unheard by the Ruey men at the gate. They were practically out
      of ammunition and had merely been awaiting a favourable opportunity to
      escape before the rebels should enter the city in force and the
      house-to-house search for snipers should begin. They had been about to
      emerge and beat a hasty retreat, when Sarros rode out at the gate, and
      with a rush they followed, gaining the sidewalk in time to be witnesses to
      the dictator's downfall.
    </p>
    <p>
      For a moment they had paused, huddled on the sidewalk behind their
      officer, who, turning to scout the street up and down, beheld John Stuart
      Webster standing by the gate with an automatic in his hand. At the same
      instant Webster's attention had been attracted to the little band on
      the sidewalk; in their leader he recognized no less a personage than his
      late acquaintance, the fire-eating Captain José Benavides. Coincidently
      Benavides recognized Webster.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was an awkward situation. Webster realized the issue was about to be
      decided, that if he would have it in his favour, he should waste not one
      split-second before killing the mercurial Benavides as the latter stood
      staring at him. It was not a question, now, of who should beat the other
      to the draw, for each had already filled his hand. It was a question,
      rather, as to who should recover first from his astonishment. If Benavides
      decided to let bygones be bygones and retreat without firing a shot, then
      Webster was quite willing to permit him to pass unmolested; indeed, such
      was his aversion to shooting any man, so earnestly did he hope the
      Sobrantean would consider that discretion was the better part of valour,
      that he resolved to inculcate that idea in the Hotspur.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Captain Benavides,&rdquo; he said suavely, &ldquo;your cause is
      lost. If you care to escape aboard the steamer, I will see to it that you
      are not removed from her before she sails; if you care to surrender to me
      now, I give you my word of honour you will not be executed.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Benavides might have had, and doubtless did have, his faults, but
      cowardice was not one of them. And he did have the ghost of a sense of
      humour. An evil smile flitted over his olive features.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Without taking into consideration the bayonets at my back,&rdquo;
      he replied, &ldquo;it strikes me the odds are even now. And yet you
      patronize me.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Webster was nettled. &ldquo;I'd rather do that than kill you,
      Benavides,&rdquo; he retorted. &ldquo;Don't be a fool. Run along and
      sell your papers, and take your pitiful little sandal-footed brigands with
      you. Scat!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Benavides's hand, holding his pistol, had been hanging loosely at
      his side. With his furious glance meeting Webster's unfalteringly,
      with the merest movement of his wrist and scarcely without movement of his
      forearm, he threw up his weapon and fired. Scarcely a fifth of a second
      had elapsed between the movement of his wrist and the pressure of his
      finger on the trigger; Webster, gazing steadily into the sombre eyes, had
      noted no hint of the man's intention, and was actually caught off
      his guard.
    </p>
    <p>
      The bullet tore through his biceps, momentarily paralyzing him, and his
      automatic dropped clattering to the sidewalk; as he stooped and recovered
      it, Benavides fired again, creasing the top of his left shoulder. The
      Sobrantean took aim for a third and finishing shot, but when he pulled the
      trigger the hammer fell on a defective cartridge, which gave to John
      Stuart Webster all the advantage he craved. He planted a bullet in
      Benavides's abdomen with his first shot, blew out the duelist's
      brains with his second, and whirled to meet the charge of the little
      sandal-footed soldados, who, seeing their leader fallen, had without an
      instant's hesitation and apparently by mutual consent decided to
      avenge him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Webster backed dazedly toward the wall, firing as he did so, but he was
      too dizzy to shoot effectively, and the semicircle of bayonets closed in
      on his front. He had wounded three men without stopping them; a second
      more, and their long, eighteen-inch bayonets would have been in his
      vitals, when into the midst of the mêlée, from the rear, dashed Don Juan
      Cafetéro, shrieking like a fiend and swinging his rifle, which he held
      grasped by the barrel.
    </p>
    <p>
      Webster saw a bayonet lunging toward him. He lifted his leg and caught the
      point on his boot-heel while with his last cartridge he killed the man
      behind the bayonet, just as the latter's next-rank man thrust
      straight and true in under the American's left arm, while a third
      man jabbed at his stomach and got the bayonet home in his hip. These two
      thrusts, delivered almost simultaneously, by their impact carried their
      victim backward against the wall, against which his head collided with a
      smart thud. He fell forward on his face; before his assailants could draw
      back for a finishing thrust, in case the gringo needed it, which they
      doubted, Don Juan Cafetéro had brained them both.
    </p>
    <p>
      Standing above the man he loved, with the latter's body between his
      outspread legs, Don Juan Cafetéro stood for the final accounting, his
      buttermilk eyes gleaming hatred and war-madness, his lips drawn back from
      his snaggle teeth, his breast rising and falling as they closed in around
      him. For a few seconds he was visible swinging his rifle like a flail,
      magnificent, unterrified&mdash;and then a bayonet slipped in under his
      guard. It was the end.
    </p>
    <p>
      With a final great effort that used up the last strength in his
      drink-corroded muscles he hurled his rifle into the midst of his four
      remaining enemies, before he swayed and toppled full length on top of
      Webster, shielding with his poor body the man who had fanned to flame the
      dying ember of manhood in the wreck that drink and the devil had cast up
      on the Caribbean coast.
    </p>
    <p>
      For Don Juan Cafetéro it had been a long, joyous, thirsty day, but at last
      the day was done. And in order to make certain, a <i>soldado</i> jabbed
      him once more through the vitals before he fled with the other survivors.

    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">F</span>OR half an hour
      after Webster left her to assist the great-hearted Mother Jenks in her
      rough care of the wounded, Dolores, absorbed in her work of mercy, gave
      all of her thought to the grim task before her. The cries, followed by the
      sudden, savage outbreak of fire when the Guards made their dash from the
      palace, brought Webster and Don Juan to mind instantly. In a quick access
      of terror and apprehension she clung, trembling, to stolid old Mother
      Jenks.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Somebody's breakin' in or breakin' out,&rdquo;
      the veteran decided calmly. &ldquo;Come to the corner, dearie, an'
      'ave a look.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      She half dragged Dolores to the corner, from which they had an
      unobstructed view down the cross-street to its intersection three blocks
      distant with the Calle San Rosario; consequently they saw the dozen or
      more survivors of that ill-fated dash from the north gate of the palace
      flash for a second across their line of vision. Mother Jenks croaked
      dismally, like a disreputable old raven; she was trying to cheer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The rats are leavin' the sinkin' ship,&rdquo; she
      wheezed. &ldquo;Come an' see them tyke the devils as killed my
      sainted 'Enery.&rdquo; She broke eagerly from Dolores's
      detaining grasp and ran down the street. Dolores hesitated a moment; then,
      reasoning that her duty lay in pursuing Mother Jenks and preventing her
      from rushing headlong into the conflict, she followed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Evidently the fleeing Guards had scurried around a corner into a
      cross-street shortly after Dolores and Mother Jenks had seen them gallop
      past, for the firing down the Calle San Rosario had ceased entirely by the
      time they reached it. They stood a moment at the corner, gazing up the
      street at the dead&mdash;man and beast&mdash;with the wounded crawling out
      of the shambles to the sidewalk.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mother Jenks nodded approvingly as triumphant shouts from the north gate
      told her the Ruey men were pouring into the palace; with their arms about
      each other the two women watched and waited&mdash;and presently the
      national flag on the palace came fluttering down from its staff, to be
      raised again with the red banner of revolution fluttering above it, the
      insignia of a nation reborn.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My lamb,&rdquo; Mother Jenks said softly to Dolores, &ldquo;the war
      is over. Wot's the matter with goin' in the south gate an'
      wytin' on the palace steps for the provisional president to make his
      grand ountray? If we 'esitate five minutes they'll have a
      bloomin' guard on both gates, arskin' us 'oo we are an'
      wot we want.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But Mr. Webster will come to that back street looking for me; I
      must go back and wait there for him.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wyte, nothink!&rdquo; Mother Jenks overruled the girl's
      protest roughly. &ldquo;'E'll 'ave gone into the palace
      with the crowd for a look-see; we'll meet 'im there an'
      syve 'im the trouble o' 'untin' for us. Come!&rdquo;
      And she half dragged the shrinking girl toward the gate, a block distant,
      where only a few minutes before Webster and Don Juan Cafetéro had made
      their ineffectual stand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don't look at the blighters, honey,&rdquo; Mother Jenks
      warned Dolores when, in approaching the gate, she caught sight of the
      bodies strewed in front of it. &ldquo;My word! Regular bally mess&mdash;an'
      all spiggoties! Cawn't be. Must 'ave been some white meat on
      this bird, as my sainted 'Enery uster s'y. Hah! Thought so!
      There's a red-headed 'un! Gawd's truth! An'
      'e done all that&mdash;Gor' strike me pink! It's Don
      Juan Cafetéro.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Mother Jenks stepped over the gory corpses ringed around Don Juan and
      knelt beside him. &ldquo;Don Juan!&rdquo; she cried. &ldquo;You bally,
      interferin' blighter, you've gone an' got it!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      She ran her strong old arms under his dripping body, lifted him and laid
      his red head on her knee, while with her free hand she drew a small flask
      of brandy from her dress pocket.
    </p>
    <p>
      Don Juan opened his buttermilk eyes and gazed up at her with slowly
      dawning wonder, then closed them again, drowsily, like a tired child.
      Mother Jenks pressed the flask to his blue lips; as the brandy bit his
      tongue he rolled his fiery head in feeble protest and weakly set his teeth
      against the lip of the flask. Wondering, Mother Jenks withdrew it&mdash;and
      then Don Juan spoke.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have ye the masther's permission, <i>allanah?</i> I give him
      me worm av honour&mdash;not&mdash;to dhrink&mdash;till&mdash;he&mdash;give&mdash;permission.
      He&mdash;was good&mdash;to me&mdash;troth he was&mdash;God&mdash;love&mdash;me&mdash;boss&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      His jaw dropped loosely; his head rolled sideways; but ere his spirit
      fled, Don Juan Cafetéro had justified the faith of his master. He had kept
      his word of honour. He had made good on his brag to die for John Stuart
      Webster and welcome the chance! Mother Jenks held his body a little while,
      gazing into the face no longer rubicund; then gently she eased it to the
      ground and for the first time was aware that Dolores knelt in the dirt
      opposite to her striving to lift the body upon which Don Juan had been
      lying.
    </p>
    <p>
      The strength of Dolores was unequal to the task; so Mother Jenks,
      hardened, courageous, calm as her sainted 'Enery at his inglorious
      finish, rose and stepped around to her side to help her. She could see
      this other was a white man, too; coolly she stooped and wiped his gory
      face with the hem of her apron. And then she recognized him!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Lift him up! Give him to me!&rdquo; Dolores sobbed. &ldquo;Oh,
      Caliph, my poor dear, big-hearted blundering boy!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      She got her arm under his head; Mother Jenks aided her; and the limp body
      was lifted to a sitting position; then Dolores knelt on one knee,
      supporting him with the other, and drew his head over on her shoulder;
      with her white cheek cuddled against his, she spoke into his deaf ears the
      little, tender, foolish words that mothers have for their children, that
      women have for the stricken men of their love. She pleaded with him to
      open his eyes, to speak to her and tell her he still lived; so close was
      his face to hers that she saw an old but very faint white scar running
      diagonally across his left eyebrow&mdash;and kissed it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Presently strong arms took him from her; clinging to somebody&mdash;she
      knew not whom&mdash;she followed, moaning broken-heartedly, while eight
      men, forming a rude litter with four rifles passed under his body, bore
      Webster to the shade of a tufted palm inside the palace gate.
    </p>
    <p>
      As they laid Webster down for a moment there Dolores saw a tall, youthful
      man, of handsome features and noble bearing, approach and look at him. In
      his eyes there were tears; a sob escaped him as with a little impulsive,
      affectionate movement he patted John Stuart Webster's cheek.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My friend!&rdquo; the fainting Dolores heard him murmur. &ldquo;My
      great-hearted, whimsical, lovable John Webster. You made it possible for
      me to meet you here to-night&mdash;and this is the meeting!&rdquo;

      CHAPTER XXVII
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">W</span>HILE Ricardo
      watched beside the unconscious Webster one of his aides galloped up the
      street, to return presently with a detachment with stretchers, into which
      Webster and Don Juan Cafetéro were laid and carried up the palace driveway
      into the huge golden reception-hall where only the night before Sarros had
      greeted the belles and beaux of his capital. In the meantime Mother Jenks
      had succeeded in restoring Dolores to consciousness; supported by the
      indomitable old woman the girl slowly followed the grim procession until,
      at the door of the reception-room, they found their further progress
      barred by a sentry.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The red-haired man is dead,&rdquo; he informed them in response to
      their eager queries. &ldquo;If you want his body,&rdquo; he continued,
      hazarding a guess as to their mission, &ldquo;I guess you can have it.
      There he is.&rdquo; And the sentry pointed to the stretcher which had been
      set down along the wall of the reception-hall.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Ow about the other?&rdquo; Mother Jenks demanded. Don Juan
      Cafetéro had, unfortunately, been so much of a nuisance to her in life
      that she was not minded to be troubled greatly over him in death, although
      the Spartanlike manner of his exit had thrilled the British bulldog blood
      in her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The big fellow isn't quite dead yet, but I'm afraid he's
      a goner. The surgeons have him in this room now. Friend of yours, Miss?&rdquo;
      he inquired in tones freighted with neighbourly sympathy.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dolores nodded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sorry I can't let you in, Miss,&rdquo; he continued, &ldquo;but
      the General ordered me to keep everybody out until the doctors have
      finished looking him over. If I was you, I'd wait in that room
      across the hall; then you can get the first news when the doctors come
      out.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Mother Jenks accepted his advice and steered her charge into the room
      indicated. And as they waited, Ricardo Ruey stood anxiously beside the
      table on which John Stuart Webster's big, limp body reposed, while
      Doctor Pacheco, assisted by a Sobrantean confrère, went deftly over him
      with surgical scissors and cut the blood-soaked clothing from his body.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He breathes very gently,&rdquo; the rebel leader said, presently.
      &ldquo;Is there any hope?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The little doctor shrugged. &ldquo;I fear not. That bayonet-thrust in the
      left side missed his heart but not his lung.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But apparently he hasn't bled much from that wound.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The hemorrhage is probably internal. Even if that congestion of
      blood in the lungs does not prove fatal very shortly, he cannot, in his
      weakened state, survive the traumatic fever from all these wounds. It is
      bound&mdash;hello, how our poor friend still lives with the bayonet broken
      off in his body&mdash;for here is steel&mdash;hah! Not a bayonet, but a
      pistol.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He unbuttoned the wounded man's coat and found a strap running
      diagonally up across his breast and over the right shoulder, connecting
      with a holster under the left arm. The doctor unbuckled this strap and
      removed the holster, which contained Webster's spare gun; Ricardo,
      glancing disinterestedly at the sheathed weapon, noted a small, new,
      triangular hole in the leather holster. He picked it up, withdrew the
      pistol, and found a deep scratch, recently made, along the blued steel
      close to the vulcanite butt.
    </p>
    <p>
      When Ricardo glanced at Pacheco after his scrutiny of the pistol and
      holster, the doctor's dark eyes were regarding him mirthfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have been unnecessarily alarmed, my general,&rdquo; said Pacheco.
      &ldquo;Our dear friend has been most fortunate in his choice of wounds&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He's a lucky Yankee; that's what he is, my dear
      Pacheco. A lucky Yankee!&rdquo; Ricardo leaned over and examined the
      bayonet-wound in Webster's left side. &ldquo;He took the point of
      the steel on this pistol he happened to be wearing under his left arm,&rdquo;
      he went on to explain. &ldquo;That turned the bayonet and it slid along
      his ribs, making a superficial flesh-wound.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Pacheco nodded. &ldquo;And this bullet merely burned the top of his right
      shoulder, while another passed through his biceps without touching the
      bone. His most severe wound is this jab in the hip.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      They stripped every stitch of clothing from Webster and went over him
      carefully. At the back of his head they found a little clotted blood from
      a small split in the scalp; also they found a lump of generous
      proportions. Pacheco laughed briefly but contentedly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then he is not even seriously injured?&rdquo; Ricardo interrupted
      that laugh.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I would die of fright if I had to fight this fine fellow a month
      from to-day,&rdquo; the little doctor chirped. &ldquo;Look at that chest,
      <i>mi general</i>&mdash;and that flat abdomen. The man is in superb
      physical condition; it is the bump on the head that renders him
      unconscious&mdash;not loss of blood.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      As if to confirm this expert testimony Webster at that moment breathed
      long and deeply, screwed up his face and shook his head very slightly.
      Thereafter for several minutes he gave no further evidence of an active
      interest in life&mdash;seeing which Pacheco decided to take prompt
      advantage of his unconsciousness and probe the wounds in his arm and
      shoulder for the fragments of clothing which the bullets must have carried
      into them. After ten minutes of probing Pacheco announced that he was
      through and ready to bandage; whereupon John Stuart Webster said faintly
      but very distinctly, in English:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm awfully glad you are, Doc'. It hurt like hell! Did
      you manage to get a bite on that fishing-trip?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Jack Webster, you scoundrel!&rdquo; Ricardo yelled joyously, and he
      shook the patient with entire disregard of the latter's wounds.
      &ldquo;Oh, man, I'm glad you're not dead.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your sentiments appeal to me strongly, my friend. I'm&mdash;too&mdash;tired
      to look&mdash;at you. Who the devil&mdash;are you?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm Ricardo.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Fell a silence, while Webster prepared for another speech. &ldquo;Where am
      I?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In the palace.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hum-m! Then it was a famous victory.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;One strong, decisive blow did the trick, old chap. We won
      pulled-up, and that forty-thousand-dollar bet of yours is safe. I'll
      cash the ticket for you tomorrow morning.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Damn the forty thousand. Where's my Croppy Boy?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your what?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My wild Irish blackthorn, Don Juan Cafetéro.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hope, old man, he has ere now that which all brave Irishmen and
      true deserve&mdash;a harp with a crown. In life the Irish have the harp
      without the crown, you know.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How did he die?&rdquo; Webster whispered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He died hard, with the holes in front&mdash;and he died for you.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Two big tears trickled slowly through Webster's closed lids and
      rolled across his pale cheek. &ldquo;Poor, lost, lonesome, misunderstood
      wreck,&rdquo; he murmured presently, &ldquo;he was an extremist in all
      things. He used to sing those wonderfully poetic ballads of his people&mdash;I
      remember one that began: 'Green were the fields where my forefathers
      dwelt.' I think his heart was in Kerry&mdash;so we'll send him
      there. He's my dead, Ricardo; care for his body, because I'm&mdash;going
      to plant Don Juan with the&mdash;shamrocks. They didn't understand
      him here. He was an exile&mdash;so I'm going to send him&mdash;home.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He shall have a military funeral,&rdquo; Rocardo promised.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;From the cathedral,&rdquo; Webster added. &ldquo;And take a picture
      of it for his people. He told me about them. I want them to think he
      amounted to something, after all. And when you get this two-by-four
      republic of yours going again, Rick, you might have your congress award
      Don Juan a thousand dollars <i>oro</i> for capturing Sarros. Then we can
      send the money to his old folks.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But he didn't capture Sarros,&rdquo; Ricardo protested.
      &ldquo;The man escaped when the Guards cut their way through.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He didn't. That was a ruse while he beat it out the gate
      where you found me. I saw Don Juan knock him cold with the but of his
      rifle after I'd brought down his horse.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you think he's there yet?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He may be&mdash;provided all this didn't happen the day
      before yesterday. If I wanted him, I'd go down and look for him,
      Rick.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'll go right away, Jack.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;One minute, then. Send a man around to that little back street
      where they have the wounded&mdash;it's a couple of blocks away from
      here&mdash;to tell Mother Jenks and the young lady with her I'll not
      be back.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They're both outside now. They must have gone looking for
      you, because they found you and Don Juan first and then told me about it.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who told you?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mother Jenks.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! Well, run along and get your man.&rdquo; Ricardo departed on
      the run, taking the sentry at the door with him and in his haste giving no
      thought to Mother Jenks and her companion waiting for the doctor's
      verdict. In the palace grounds he gathered two more men and bade them
      follow him; leading by twenty yards, he emerged at the gate and paused to
      look around him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Some hundred feet down the street from the palace gate Sarros's bay
      charger lay dead. When Webster's bullet brought the poor beast down,
      his rider had fallen clear of him, only to fall a victim to the ferocity
      of Don Juan Cafetéro. Later, as Sarros lay stunned and bleeding beside his
      mount, the stricken animal in its death-struggle had half risen, only to
      fall again, this time on the extended left leg of his late master;
      consequently when Sarros recovered consciousness following the thoughtful
      attentions of his assailant, it was to discover himself a hopeless
      prisoner. The heavy carcass of his horse pinned his foot and part of his
      leg to the ground, rendering him as helpless and desperate as a trapped
      animal. For several minutes now he had been striving frantically to
      release himself; with his sound right leg pressed against the animal's
      backbone he tried to gain sufficient purchase to withdraw his left leg
      from the carcass.
    </p>
    <p>
      As Ricardo caught sight of Sarros he instinctively realized that this was
      his mortal enemy; motioning his men to stand back, he approached the
      struggling man on tiptoe and thoughtfully possessed himself of the
      dictator's pistol, which lay in back of him but not out of reach.
      Just as he did so, Sarros, apparently convinced of the futility of his
      efforts to free himself, surrendered to fate and commenced rather
      pitifully to weep with rage and despair.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ricardo watched him for a few seconds, for there was just sufficient of
      the blood of his Castilian ancestors still in his veins to render this
      sorry spectacle rather an enjoyable one to him. Besides, he was 50 per
      cent. Iberian, a race which can hate quite as thoroughly as it can love,
      and for a time Ricardo even nourished the thought of still further
      indulging his thirst for revenge by pretending to aid Sarros in his
      escape! Presently, however, he put the ungenerous thought from him;
      seizing the dead horse by the tail, he dragged the carcass off his enemy's
      leg, and while Sarros sat up, tailor-fashion, and commenced to tub the
      circulation back into the bruised member, Ricardo seated himself on the
      rump of the dead horse and appraised his prisoner critically.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sarros glanced up, remembered his manners and very heartily and gracefully
      thanked his deliverer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is not a matter for which thanks are due me, Sarros,&rdquo;
      Ricardo replied coldly. &ldquo;I am Ricardo Luiz Ruey, and I have come
      back to Sobrante to pay my father's debt to you. You will remember
      having forced the obligation upon me in the cemetery some fifteen years
      ago.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      For perhaps ten horrified seconds Sarros stared at Ricardo; then the dark
      blood in him came to his defense; his tense pose relaxed; the fright and
      despair left his swarthy countenance as if erased with a moist sponge,
      leaving him as calmly stoical and indifferent as a cigarstore Indian. He
      fumbled in his coat pocket for a gold cigarette case, selected a
      cigarette, lighted it and blew smoke at Ricardo. The jig was up; he knew
      it; and with admirable nonchalance he declined to lower his presidential
      dignity by discussing or considering it. He realized it would delight his
      captor to know he dreaded to face the issue, and it was not a Sarros
      practice to give aid and comfort to the enemy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Spunky devil!&rdquo; Ricardo reflected, forced to admiration
      despite himself. Aloud he said: &ldquo;You know the code of our people,
      Sarros. An eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Sarros bowed. &ldquo;I am at your service,&rdquo; he replied carelessly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then at daylight to-morrow morning I shall make settlement.&rdquo;
      Ricardo beckoned his men to approach. &ldquo;Take this man and confine him
      under a double guard in the arsenal,&rdquo; he ordered. &ldquo;Present my
      compliments to the officer in charge there and tell him it is my wish that
      a priest be provided for the prisoner to-night, and that to-morrow
      morning, at six o'clock, a detail of six men and a sergeant escort
      this man to the cemetery in the rear of the Catedral de la Cruz. I will
      meet the detail there and take command of it.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Two of Ricardo's imported fighting men stepped to the prisoner's
      side, seized him, one by each arm, and lifted him to his feet; supported
      between them, he limped away to his doom, while his youthful conqueror
      remained seated on the dead horse, his gaze bent upon the ground, his mind
      dwelling, not upon his triumph over Sarros but upon the prodigious
      proportions of the task before him: the rehabilitation of a nation. After
      a while he rose and strolled over toward the gate, where he paused to note
      the grim evidences of the final stand of Webster and Don Juan Cafetéro
      before passing through the portal. .
    </p>
    <p>
      Ricardo had now, for the first time, an opportunity to look around him; so
      he halted to realize his homecoming, to thrill with this, the first real
      view of the home of his boyhood. The spacious lawn surrounding the palace
      had been plowed and scarred with bursting shrapnel from the field guns
      captured in the arsenal, although the building itself had been little
      damaged, not having sustained a direct hit because of Ricardo's
      stringent orders not to use artillery on the palace unless absolutely
      necessary to smoke Sarros out. Scattered over the grounds Ricardo counted
      some twenty-odd Government soldiers, all wearing that pathetically flat,
      crumpled appearance which seems inseparable from the bodies of men killed
      in action. The first shrapnel had probably commenced to drop in the
      grounds just as a portion of the palace garrison had been marching out to
      join the troops fighting at the cantonment barracks. Evidently the men had
      scattered like quail, only to be killed as they ran.
    </p>
    <p>
      From this grim scene Ricardo raised his eyes to the palace, the
      castellated towers of which, looming through the tufted palms, were
      reflecting the setting sun. Over the balustrade of one of the upper
      balconies the limp body of a Sarros sharpshooter, picked off from the
      street, drooped grotesquely, his arms hanging downward as if in ironical
      welcome to the son of Ruey the Beloved. The sight induced in Ricardo a
      sense of profound sadness; his Irish imagination awoke; to him that mute
      figure seemed to call upon him for pity, for kindness, for forbearance,
      for understanding and sympathy. Those outflung arms of the martyred peon
      symbolized to Ricardo Ruey the spirit of liberty, shackled and helpless,
      calling upon him for deliverance; they brought to his alert mind a clearer
      realization of the duty that was his than he had ever had before. He had a
      great task to perform, a task inaugurated by his father, and which Ricardo
      could not hope to finish in his lifetime. He must solve the agrarian
      problem; he must develop the rich natural resources of his country; he
      must provide free, compulsory education and evolve from the ignorance of
      the peon an intelligence that would built up that which Sobrante, in
      common with her sister republics, so woefully lacked&mdash;the great
      middle class that stands always as a buffer between the aggression and
      selfishness of the upper class and the helplessness and childishness of
      the lower.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ricardo bowed his head. &ldquo;Help me, O Lord,&rdquo; he prayed. &ldquo;Thou
      hast give me in Thy wisdom a man's task. Help me that I may not
      prove unworthy.&rdquo;

      CHAPTER XXVIII
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">M</span>OTHER JENKS, grown
      impatient at the lack of news concerning Webster, left Dolores to her
      grief in the room across the hall and sought the open air, for of late she
      had been experiencing with recurring frequency a slight feeling of
      suffocation. She sat down on the broad granite steps, helped herself to a
      much-needed &ldquo;bracer&rdquo; from her brandy flask and was gazing
      pensively at the scene around her when Ricardo came up the stairs.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Elio!&rdquo; Mother Jenks saluted him. &ldquo;W'ere
      'ave you been, Mr. Bowers?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have just returned from capturing Sarros, Mrs. Jenks. He is on
      his way to the arsenal under guard.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Gor' strike me pink!&rdquo; the old lady cried. &ldquo;'Ave
      I lived to see this day!&rdquo; Her face was wreathed in a happy smile.
      &ldquo;I wonder 'ow the beggar feels to 'ave the shoe on the
      other foot, eh&mdash;the'eartless'ound! I'm 'opin'
      this General Ruey will 'ave the blighter shot.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You need have no worry on that score, Mrs. Jenks. I'm General
      Ruey. Andrew Bowers was just my summer name, as it were.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Angels guard me! Wot the bloomin' 'ell surprise won't
      we 'ave next. Wot branch o' the Ruey tribe do you belong to?
      Are you a nephew o' him that was president before Sarros shot
      'im? Antonio Ruey, who was 'arf brother to the president,
      'ad a son 'e called Ricardo. Are you 'im, might I arsk?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am the son of Ricardo the Beloved,&rdquo; he answered proudly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not the lad as was away at school when 'is father was
      hexecuted?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am that same lad, Mrs. Jenks. And who are you? You seem to know a
      deal of my family history.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I,&rdquo; the old publican replied with equal pride, &ldquo;am Mrs.
      Colonel 'Enery Jenks, who was your father's chief of
      hartillery an' 'ad the hextreme honour o' dyin' in
      front o' the same wall with 'im. By the w'y, 'ow's
      Mr. Webster?&rdquo; she added, suddenly remembering the subject closest to
      her heart just then.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;His wounds are trifling. He'll live, Mrs. Jenks.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, that's better than gettin' poked in the eye with
      a sharp stick,&rdquo; the old dame decided philosophically.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you remember my little sister, Mrs. Jenks?&rdquo; Ricardo
      continued. &ldquo;She was in the palace when Sarros attacked it; she
      perished there.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I believe I 'ave got a slight recollection o' the
      nipper, sir,&rdquo; Mother Jenks answered cautiously. To herself she said:
      &ldquo;I s'y, 'Enrietta, 'ere's a pretty go.
      'E don't know the lamb is livin' an' in the next
      room! My word, wot a riot w'en 'e meets 'er!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will see you again, Mrs. Jenks. I must have a long talk with you,&rdquo;
      Ricardo told her, and passed on into the palace; whereupon Mother Jenks
      once more fervently implored the Almighty to strike her pink, and the iron
      restraint of a long, hard, exciting day being relaxed at last, the good
      soul bowed her gray head in her arms and wept, moving her body from side
      to side the while and demanding, of no one in particular, a single
      legitimate reason why she, a blooming old baggage and not fit to live,
      should be the recipient of such manifold blessings as this day had brought
      forth.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the meantime Ricardo, with his hand on the knob of the door leading to
      the room where Webster was having his wounds dressed, paused suddenly, his
      attention caught by the sound of a sob, long-drawn and inexpressibly
      pathetic. He listened and made up his mind that a woman in the room across
      the entrance-hall was bewailing the death of a loved one who answered to
      the name of Caliph and John darling. Further eavesdropping convinced him
      that Caliph, John darling, and Mr. John Stuart Webster were one and the
      same person, and so he tilted his head on one side like a cock-robin and
      considered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By jingo, that's most interesting,&rdquo; he decided. &ldquo;The
      wounded hero has a sweetheart or a wife&mdash;and an American, too. She
      must be a recent acquisition, because all the time we were together on the
      steamer coming down here he never spoke of either, despite the fact that
      we got friendly enough for such confidences. Something funny about this. I'd
      better sound the old boy before I start passing out words of comfort to
      that unhappy female.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He passed on into the room. John Stuart Webster had, by this time, been
      washed and bandaged, and one of the Sarros servants (for the ex-dictator's
      retinue still occupied the palace) had, at Doctor Pacheco's command,
      prepared a guest-chamber upstairs and furnished a nightgown of ample
      proportions to cover Mr. Webster's bebandaged but otherwise naked
      person. A stretcher had just arrived, and the wounded man was about to be
      carried upstairs. The late financial backer of the revolution was looking
      very pale and dispirited; for once in his life his whimsical, bantering
      nature was subdued. His eyes were closed, and he did not open them when
      Ricardo entered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I have Sarros,&rdquo; the latter declared. Webster paid not
      the slightest attention to this announcement. Ricardo bent over him.
      &ldquo;Jack, old boy,&rdquo; he queried, &ldquo;do you know a person of
      feminine persuasion who calls you Caliph?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      John Stuart Webster's eyes and mouth flew wide open. &ldquo;What the
      devil!&rdquo; he tried to roar. &ldquo;You haven't been speaking to
      her, have you? If you have, I'll never forgive you, because you've
      spoiled my little surprise party.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, I haven't been speaking to her, but she's in the
      next room crying fit to break her heart because she thinks you've
      been killed.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You scoundrel! Aren't you human? Go tell her it's only
      a couple of punctures, not a blowout.&rdquo; He sighed. &ldquo;Isn't
      it sweet of her to weep over an old hunks like me!&rdquo; he added softly.
      &ldquo;Bless her tender heart!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who is she?&rdquo; Ricardo was very curious.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's none of your business. You wait and I'll tell
      you. She's the guest I told you I was going to bring to dinner, and
      that's enough for you to know for the present. <i>Vaya</i>, you
      idiot, and bring her in here, so I can assure her my head is bloody but
      unbowed. Doctor, throw that rug over my shanks and make me look pretty. I'm
      going to receive company.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      His glance, bent steadily on the door, had in it some of the alert, bright
      wistfulness frequently to be observed in the eyes of a terrier standing
      expectantly before a rat-hole. The instant the door opened and Dolores's
      tear-stained face appeared, he called to her with the old-time
      camaraderie, for he had erased from his mind, for the nonce, the memory of
      the tragedy of poor Don Juan Cafetéro and was concerned solely with the
      task of banishing the tears from those brown eyes and bringing the joy of
      life back to that sweet face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hello, Seeress,&rdquo; he called weakly. &ldquo;Little Johnny's
      been fighting again, and the bad boys gave him an all-fired walloping.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a swift rustle of skirts, and she was bending over him, her hot
      little palms clasping eagerly his pale, rough cheeks. &ldquo;Oh, my dear,
      my dear!&rdquo; she whispered, and then her voice choked with the happy
      tears and she was sobbing on his wounded shoulder. Ricardo stooped to draw
      her away, but John Stuart bent upon him a look of such frightfulness that
      he drew back abashed. After all, the past twenty-four hours had been quite
      exciting, and Ricardo reflected that John's inamorata was tired and
      frightened and probably hadn't eaten anything all day long, so there
      was ample excuse for her hysteria.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come, come, buck up,&rdquo; Webster soothed her, and helped himself
      to a long whiff of her fragrant hair. &ldquo;Old man Webster had one leg
      in the grave, but they've pulled it out again.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Still she sobbed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, listen to me, lady,&rdquo; he commanded with mock severity.
      &ldquo;You just stop that. You're wasting your sympathy; and while,
      of course, I enjoy your sympathy a heap, just pause to reflect on the
      result if those salt tears should happen to drop into one of my numerous
      wounds.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm so sorry for you, Caliph,&rdquo; she murmured brokenly.
      &ldquo;You poor, harmless boy! I don't see how any one could be so
      fiendish as to hurt you when you were so distinctly a non-combatant.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank you. Let us forget the Hague Conference for the present,
      however. Have you met your brother?&rdquo; he whispered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, Caliph.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ricardo.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, Jack.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come here. Rick, you scheming, unscrupulous, bloodthirsty
      adventurer, I have a tremendous surprise in store for you. The sweetest
      girl in the world&mdash;and she's right here&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Ricardo laughingly held up his hand. &ldquo;Jack, my friend,&rdquo; he
      interrupted, &ldquo;you're too weak to make a speech. Don't do
      it. Besides, you do not have to.&rdquo; He turned and bowed gracefully to
      Dolores. &ldquo;I can see for myself she's the sweetest girl in the
      world, and that she's right here.&rdquo; He held out his hand to
      her. &ldquo;Jack thinks he's going to spring a surprise,&rdquo; he
      continued maliciously, &ldquo;quite forgetting that a good soldier never
      permits himself to be taken by surprise. I know all about his little
      secret, because I heard you mourning for him when you thought he was dead.&rdquo;
      Ricardo favoured her with a knowing wink. &ldquo;I am delighted to meet
      the future Mrs. Webster. I quite understand why you fell in love with him,
      because, you see, I love him myself and do does everybody else.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      With typical Castilian courtliness he took her hand, bowed low over it,
      and kissed it. &ldquo;I am Ricardo Luiz Ruey,&rdquo; he said, anxious to
      spare his friend the task of further exhausting conversation. &ldquo;And
      you are&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You're a consummate jackass!&rdquo; groaned Webster. &ldquo;I'm
      only a dear old family friend, and Dolores is going to marry Billy Geary.
      You impetuous idiot! She's your own sister Dolores Ruey. She, Mark
      Twain, and I have ample cause for common complaint against the world
      because the reports of our death have been grossly exaggerated. She didn't
      perish when your father's administration crumbled. Miss Ruey, this
      is your brother Ricardo. Kiss her you damn' fool&mdash;forgive me,
      Miss Ruey&mdash;oh, Lord, nothing matters any more. He's gummed
      everything up and ruined my party. I wish I were dead.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Ricardo stared from the outraged Webster to his sister and back again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Jack Webster,&rdquo; he declared, &ldquo;you aren't crazy,
      are you?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course he is&mdash;the old dear,&rdquo; Dolores cried happily,
      &ldquo;but I'm not.&rdquo; She stepped up to her brother, and her
      arms went around his neck. &ldquo;Oh, Rick,&rdquo; she cried, &ldquo;I'm
      your sister. Truly, I am.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dolores. My little lost sister Dolores? Why, I can't believe
      it!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, you'd better believe it,&rdquo; John Stuart Webster
      growled feebly. &ldquo;Of course, you can doubt my word and get away with
      it, now that I'm flat on my back, but if you dare cast aspersions on
      that girl's veracity, I'll murder you a month from now.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He closed his eyes, feeling instinctively that he ought not spy on such a
      sacred family scene. When, however, the affecting meeting was over and
      Dolores was ruffling the Websterian foretop while her brother pressed the
      Websterian hand and tried to say all the things he felt but couldn't
      express, John Stuart Webster brought them both back to a realization of
      present conditions.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don't thank me, sir,&rdquo; he piped in pathetic imitation of
      the small boy of melodrama. &ldquo;I have only done me duty, and for that
      I cannot accept this purse of gold, even though my father and mother are
      starving.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Caliph, do be serious,&rdquo; Dolores pleaded.
    </p>
    <p>
      He looked up at her fondly. &ldquo;Take your brother out to Mother Jenks
      and prove your case, Miss Ruey,&rdquo; he advised her. &ldquo;And while
      you're at it, I certainly hope somebody will remember I'm not
      accustomed to reposing on a centre table. Rick, if you can persuade some
      citizen of this conquered commonwealth to put me to bed, I'd be
      obliged. I'm dead tired, old horse. I'm&mdash;ah&mdash;sleepy&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      His head rolled weakly to one side, for he had been playing a part and had
      nerved himself to finish it gracefully, even in his weakened condition. He
      sighed, moaned slightly, and slipped into unconsciousness.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXIX
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">T</span>HROUGHOUT the
      night there was sporadic firing here and there in the city, as the Ruey
      followers relentlessly hunted down the isolated detachment of Government
      troops which had escaped annihilation and capture in the final rout and
      fallen back on the city, where, concealing themselves according to their
      nature and inclination, they indulged in more or less sniping from windows
      and the roofs of buildings. The practice of taking no prisoners was an old
      one in Sobrante, and few presidents had done more than Sarros to keep that
      custom alive; ergo, firm in the conviction that to surrender was
      tantamount to facing a firing squad at daylight, the majority of these
      stragglers, with consummate courage, fought to the death.
    </p>
    <p>
      The capture of Buenaventura was alone sufficient to insure a brief
      revolution, but the capture of Sarros was ample guarantee that the
      resistance to the new order of things was already at an end. However,
      Ricardo Ruey felt that the prompt execution of Sarros would be an added
      guarantee of peace by effectually discouraging any opposition to the rebel
      cause in the outlying districts, where a few isolated garrisons still
      remained in ignorance of the momentous events being enacted in the
      capital. For the time being, Ricardo was master of life and death in
      Sobrante, and all of his advisers and supporters agreed with him that a
      so-called trial of the ex-dictator would be a rather useless affair. His
      life was forfeit a hundred times for murder and treason, and to be
      ponderous over his elimination would savour of mockery. Accordingly, at
      midnight, a priest entered the room in the arsenal where Sarros was
      confined, and shrived him. Throughout the night the priest remained with
      him, and when that early morning march to the cemetery commenced, he
      walked beside Sarros, repeating the prayers for the dying.
    </p>
    <p>
      Upon reaching the cemetery there was a slight wait until a carriage drove
      up and discharged Ricardo Ruey and Mother Jenks. The sergeant in command
      of the squad saluted and was briefly ordered to proceed with the matter in
      hand; whereupon he turned to Sarros, who with the customary <i>sang froid</i>
      of his kind upon such occasions was calmly smoking, and bowed
      deprecatingly. Sarros actually smiled upon him. &ldquo;<i>Adios, amigos</i>&rdquo;
      he murmured. Then, as an afterthought and probably because he was
      sufficient of an egoist to desire to appear a martyr, he added heroically:
      &ldquo;I die for my country. May God have mercy on my enemies.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you'd cared to play a gentleman's game, you
      blighter, you might 'ave lived for your bally country,&rdquo; Mother
      Jenks reminded him in English. &ldquo;Wonder if the beggar 'll wilt
      or will 'e go through smilin' like my sainted 'Enery on
      the syme spot.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      She need not have worried. It requires a strong man to be dictator of a
      Roman-candle republic for fifteen years, and whatever his sins of omission
      or commission, Sarros did not lack animal courage. Alone and unattended he
      limped away among the graves to the wall on the other side of the cemetery
      and placed his back against it, negligently in the attitude of a
      devil-may-care fellow without a worry in life. The sergeant waited
      respectfully until Sarros had finished his cigarette; when he tossed it
      away and straightened to attention, the sergeant knew he was ready to die.
      At his command there was a sudden rattle of bolts as the cartridges slid
      from the magazines into the breeches; there followed a momentary halt,
      another command; the squad was aiming when Ricardo Ruey called sharply:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sergeant, do not give the order to fire.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The rifles were lowered and the men gazed wonderingly at Ricardo. &ldquo;He's
      too brave,&rdquo; Ricardo complained. &ldquo;Damn him, I can't kill
      him as I would a mad-dog. I've got to give him a chance.&rdquo; The
      sergeant raised his brows expressively. Ah, the <i>ley fuga</i>, that
      popular form of execution where the prisoner is given a running chance,
      and the firing-squad practises wing shooting If the prisoner manages,
      miraculously, to escape, he is not pursued!
    </p>
    <p>
      A doubt, however, crossed the sergeant's mind. &ldquo;But, my
      general,&rdquo; he expostulated, &ldquo;Senor Sarros cannot accept the <i>ley
      fuga</i>. He is very lame. That is not giving him the chance your
      Excellency desires he should have.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wasn't thinking of that,&rdquo; Ricardo replied. &ldquo;I
      was thinking I'm killing him without a fair trial for the reason
      that he's so infernally ripe for the gallows that a trial would have
      been a joke. Nevertheless, I am really killing him because he killed my
      father&mdash;and that is scarcely fair. My father was a gentleman.
      Sergeant, is your pistol loaded?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, General.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Give it to Senor Sarros.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      As the sergeant started forward to comply Ricardo drew his own service
      revolver and then motioned Mother Jenks and the firing-squad to stand
      aside while he crossed to the centre of the cemetery. &ldquo;Sarros,&rdquo;
      he called, &ldquo;I am going to let God decide which one of us shall live.
      When the sergeant gives the command to fire, I shall open fire on you, and
      you are free to do the same to me. Sergeant, if he kills me and escapes
      unhurt, my orders are to escort him to the bay in my carriage and put him
      safely aboard the steamer.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Mother Jenks sat down on a tombstone. &ldquo;Gord's truth!&rdquo;
      she gasped, &ldquo;but there's a rare plucked 'un.&rdquo;
      Aloud she croaked: &ldquo;Don't be a bally ass, sir.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Silence!&rdquo; he commanded.
    </p>
    <p>
      The sergeant handed Sarros the revolver. &ldquo;You heard what I said?&rdquo;
      Ricardo called.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sarros bowed gravely.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You understand your orders, Sergeant?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, General.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very well. Proceed. If this prisoner fires before you give the
      word, have your squad riddle him.&rdquo; The sergeant backed away and
      gazed owlishly from the prisoner to his captor. &ldquo;Ready!&rdquo; he
      called. Both revolvers came up. &ldquo;Fire!&rdquo; he shouted, and the
      two shots were discharged simultaneously. Ricardo's cap flew off his
      head, but he remained standing, while Sarros staggered back against the
      wall and there recovering himself gamely, fired again. He scored a clean
      miss, and Ricardo's gun barked three times; Sarros sprawled on his
      face, rose to his knees, raised his pistol halfway, fired into the sky and
      slid forward on his face. Ricardo stood beside the body until the sergeant
      approached and stood to attention, his attitude saying:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is over. What next, General?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Take the squad back to the arsenal, Sergeant,&rdquo; Ricardo
      ordered him coolly, and walked back to recover his uniform cap. He was
      smiling as he ran his finger through a gaping hole in the upper half of
      the crown.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, Mrs. Jenks,&rdquo; he announced when he rejoined the old
      lady, &ldquo;that was better than executing him with a firing-squad. I
      gave him a square deal. Now his friends can never say that I murdered him.&rdquo;
      He extended his hand to help Mother Jenks to her feet. She stood erect and
      felt again that queer swelling of the heart, the old feeling of
      suffocation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Steady, lass!&rdquo; she mumbled. &ldquo;'Old on to me, sir.
      It's my bally haneurism. Gor'&mdash;I'm&mdash;chokin'&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He caught her in his arms as she lurched toward him. Her face was purple,
      and in her eyes there was a queer fierce light that went out suddenly,
      leaving them dull and glazed. When she commenced to sag in his arms, he
      eased her gently to the ground and laid her on her back in the grass.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The nipper's safe, 'Enery,&rdquo; he heard her murmur.
      &ldquo;I've raised 'er a lydy, s'elp me&mdash;she's
      back where&mdash;you found 'er&mdash; 'Enery&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      She quivered, and the light came creeping back into her eyes before it
      faded forever. &ldquo;Comin', 'Enery&mdash;darlin',&rdquo;
      she whispered; and then the soul of Mother Jenks, who had a code and lived
      up to it (which is more than the majority of us do), had departed upon the
      ultimate journey. Ricardo gazed down on the hard old mouth, softened now
      by a little half-smile of mingled yearning and gladness: &ldquo;What a
      wonderful soul you had,&rdquo; he murmured, and kissed her.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the end she slept in the niche in the wall of the Catedral de la Vera
      Cruz, beside her sainted 'Enery.

      CHAPTER XXX
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">T</span>HREE days passed.
      Don Juan Cafetéro had been buried with all the pomp and circumstance of a
      national hero; Mother Jenks, too, had gone to her appointed resting-place,
      and El Buen Amigo had been closed forever. Ricardo had issued a
      proclamation announcing himself provisional president of Sobrante; a
      convention of revolutionary leaders had been held, and a provisional
      cabinet selected. A day for the national elections had been named; the
      wreckage of the brief revolution had been cleared away, and the wheels of
      government were once more revolving freely and noiselessly. And while all
      of this had been going on, John Stuart Webster had lain on his back,
      staring at the palace ceiling and absolutely forbidden to receive
      visitors. He was still engaged in this mild form of gymnastics on the
      third day when the door of his room opened and Dolores looked in on him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good evening, Caliph,&rdquo; she called. &ldquo;Aren't you
      dead yet?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      It was exactly the tone she should have adopted to get the best results,
      for Webster had been mentally and physically ill since she had seen him
      last, and needed some such pleasantry as this to lift him out of his
      gloomy mood. He grinned at her boyishly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, I'm not dead. On the contrary, I'm feeling real
      chirpy. Won't you come in and visit for a while, Miss Ruey?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, since you've invited me, I shall accept.&rdquo;
      Entering, she stood beside his bed and took the hand he extended toward
      Her. &ldquo;This is the first opportunity I've had, Miss Ruey,&rdquo;
      he began, &ldquo;to apologize for the shock I gave you the other day. I
      should have come back to you as I promised, instead of getting into a
      fight and scaring you half to death. I hope you'll forgive me,
      because I'm paying for my fun now&mdash;with interest.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very well, Caliph. I'll forgive you&mdash;on one condition.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who am I to resist having a condition imposed upon me? Name your
      terms. I shall obey.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm weary of being called Miss Ruey. I want to be Dolores&mdash;to
      you.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By the toenails of Moses,&rdquo; he reflected, &ldquo;there is no
      escape. She's determined to rock the boat.&rdquo; Aloud he said:
      &ldquo;All right, Dolores. I suppose I may as well take the license of the
      old family friend. I guess Bill won't mind.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Billy hasn't a word to say about it,&rdquo; she retorted,
      regarding him with that calm, impersonal, yet vitally interested look that
      always drove him frantic with the desire for her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, of course, I understand that,&rdquo; he countered. &ldquo;Naturally,
      since Bill is only a man, you'll have to manage him and he'll
      have to take orders.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Caliph, you're a singularly persistent man, once you get an
      idea into your head. Please understand me, once for all: Billy Geary is a
      dear, and it's a mystery to me why every girl in the world isn't
      perfectly crazy about him, but every rule has its exceptions&mdash;and
      Billy and I are just good friends. I'd like to know where you got
      the idea we're engaged to be married.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why&mdash;why&mdash;well, aren't you?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainly not.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, you&mdash;er&mdash;you ought to be. I expected&mdash;that is,
      I planned&mdash;I mean Bill told me and&mdash;and&mdash;and&mdash;er&mdash;it
      never occurred to me you could possibly have the&mdash;er&mdash;crust&mdash;to
      refuse him. Of course you're going to marry him when he asks you?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course I am not.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah-h-h-h!&rdquo; John Stuart Webster gazed at her in frank
      amazement. &ldquo;Not going to marry Bill Geary!&rdquo; he cried, highly
      scandalized.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know you think I ought to, and I suppose it will appear quite
      incomprehensible to you when I do not&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, Dolores, my dear girl! This is most amazing. Didn't Bill
      ask you to marry him before he left?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, he did me that honour, and I declined him.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You <i>what!</i>&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      She smiled at him so maternally that his hand itched to drag her down to
      him and kiss her curving lips.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you mind telling me just why you took this extraordinary
      attitude?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have no right to ask, but I'll tell you. I refused Billy
      because I didn't love him enough&mdash;that way. What's more,
      I never could.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He rolled his head to one side and softly, very softly, whistled two bars
      of &ldquo;The Spanish Cavalier&rdquo; through his teeth He was properly
      thunder-struck&mdash;so much so, in fact, that for a moment he actually
      forgot her presence the while he pondered this most incredible state of
      affairs.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I see it all now. It's as clear as mud,&rdquo; he announced
      finally. &ldquo;You refused poor old Bill and broke his heart, and so he
      went away and hasn't had the courage to write me since. I'm
      afraid Bill and I both regarded this fight as practically won&mdash;all
      over but the wedding-march, as one might put it. I might as well confess I
      hustled the boy down from the mine just so you two could get married and
      light out on your honeymoon I figured Bill could kill two birds with one
      stone&mdash;have his honeymoon and get rid of his malaria, and return here
      in three or four months to relieve me, after I had the mine in operation.
      Poor boy. That was a frightful song-and-dance you gave him.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suspected you were the matchmaker in this case. I must say I
      think you're old enough to know better, Caliph John.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You did, eh? Well, what made you think so?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      She chuckled. &ldquo;Oh, you're very obvious&mdash;to a woman.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I forgot that you reveal the past and foretell the future.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are really very clumsy, Caliph. You should never try to direct
      the destiny of any woman.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm on the sick list,&rdquo; he pleaded, &ldquo;and it isn't
      sporting of you to discuss me. You're healthy&mdash;so let us
      discuss you. Dolores, do you figure Bill's case to be absolutely
      hopeless?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Absolutely, Caliph.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hum-m-m!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Again Webster had recourse to meditation, seeing which, Dolores walked to
      the pier-glass in the corner, satisfied herself that her coiffure was just
      so and returned to his side, singing softly a little song that had floated
      out over the transom of Webster's room door into the hall one night:
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      A Spanish cavalier,
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      Went out to rope a steer,
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      Along with his paper <i>cigar-r-ro!</i>
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      &ldquo;<i>Caramba!</i>&rdquo; said he.
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      &ldquo;<i>Manana</i> you will be
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      <i>Muchù bueno carne por mio</i>&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      He turned his head and looked up at her suddenly, searchingly. &ldquo;Is
      there anybody else in Bill's way?&rdquo; he demanded. &ldquo;I admit
      it's none of my business, but&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;-&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, Caliph, there is some one else.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I thought so.&rdquo; This rather viciously. &ldquo;I'm
      willing to gamble a hundred to one, sight unseen, that whoever he is, he
      isn't half the man Bill is.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That,&rdquo; she replied coldly, &ldquo;is a matter of personal
      opinion.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And Bill's clock is fixed for keeps?'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, Caliph. And he never had a chance from the start.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why not?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I met the other man first, Caliph.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! Do you mind telling me what this other man does for a living?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He's a mining man, like Billy.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All right! Has the son of a horsethief got a mine like Bill's?
      That's something to consider, Dolores.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He has a mine fully as good as Billy's. Like Billy, he owns a
      half interest in it, too.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hum-m-m! How long have you known him?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not very long.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Be sure you're right&mdash;then go ahead,&rdquo; John Stuart
      Webster warned her. &ldquo;Don't marry in haste and repent at
      leisure, Dolores. Know your man before you let him buy the wedding ring.
      There's a heap of difference, my dear, between sentiment and
      sentimentality.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm sure of my man, Caliph.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He was silent again, thinking rapidly. &ldquo;Well, of course,&rdquo; he
      began again presently, &ldquo;while there was the slightest possibility of
      Bill winning you, I would have died before saying that which I am about to
      say to you now, Dolores, because Bill is my friend, and I'd never
      double-cross him. With reference to this other man, however, I have no
      such code to consider. I'm pretty well convinced I'm out of
      the running, but I'll give that lad a race if it's the last
      act of my life. He's a stranger to me, and he isn't on the job
      to protect his claim, so why shouldn't I stake it if I can? But are
      you quite certain you aren't making a grave mistake in refusing
      Billy? He's quite a boy, my dear. I know him from soul to
      suspenders, and he'd be awfully good to you. He's kind and
      gentle and considerate, and he's not a mollycoddle, either.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can't help it, Caliph. Please don't talk about him
      any more. I know somebody who is kinder and nobler and gentler.&rdquo; She
      ceased abruptly, fearful of breaking down her reserve and saying too much.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, if Bill's case is hopeless&rdquo;&mdash;his hand came
      groping for hers, while he held her with his searching, wistful glance&mdash;&ldquo;I
      wonder what mine looks like. That is, Dolores, I&mdash;I&mdash;&mdash;'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, John?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I've played fair with my friend,&rdquo; he whispered eagerly.
      &ldquo;I'm not going to ask you to marry me, but I want to tell you
      that to me you're such a very wonderful woman I can't help
      loving you with my whole heart and soul.'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have suspected this, John,&rdquo; she replied gravely.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suppose so. I'm such an obvious old fool. I've had my
      dream, and I've put it behind me, but I&mdash;I just want you to
      know I love you; so long as I live, I shall want to serve you when you're
      married to this other man, and things do not break just right for you both&mdash;if
      I have something he wants, in order to make you happy, I want you to know
      it's yours to give to him. I&mdash;I&mdash;I guess that's all,
      Dolores.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank you, John. Would you like to know this man I'm going to
      marry?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I think I'd like to congratulate the scoundrel.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then I'll introduce you to him, John. I first met him on a
      train in Death Valley, California. He was a shaggy old dear, all whiskers
      and rags, but his whiskers couldn't hide his smile, and his rags
      couldn't hide his manhood, and when he thrashed a drummer because
      the man annoyed me, I just couldn't help falling in love with him.
      Even when he fibbed to me and disputed my assertion that we had met before&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good land of love&mdash;and the calves got loose!&rdquo; he almost
      shouted as he held up his one sound arm to her. &ldquo;My dear, my dear&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, sweetheart,&rdquo; she whispered laying her hot cheek against
      his, &ldquo;it's taken you so long to say it, but I love you all the
      more for the dear thoughts that made you hesitate.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He was silent a few moments, digesting his amazement, speechless with the
      great happiness that was his&mdash;and then Dolores was kissing the back
      of the hand of that helpless, bandaged arm lying across his breast. He had
      a tightening in his throat, for he had not expected love; and that sweet,
      benignant, humble little kiss spelled adoration and eternal surrender;
      when she looked at him again the mists of joy were in his eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dear old Caliph John!&rdquo; she crooned. &ldquo;He's never
      had a woman to understand his funny ways and appreciate them and take care
      of him, has he?&rdquo; She patted his cheek. &ldquo;And bless his simple
      old heart, he would rather give up his love than be false to his friend.
      Yes, indeed. Johnny Webster respects 'No Shooting' signs when
      he sees them, but he tells fibs and pretends to be very stupid when he
      really isn't. So you wouldn't be false to Billy&mdash;eh,
      dear? I'm glad to know that, because the man who cannot be false to
      his friend can never be false to his wife.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He crushed her down to him and held her there for a long time. &ldquo;My
      dear,&rdquo; he said presently, &ldquo;isn't there something you
      have to say to me?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I love you, John,&rdquo; she whispered, and sealed the sweet
      confession with a true lover's kiss.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All's well with the world,&rdquo; John Stuart Webster
      announced when he could use his lips once more for conversation. &ldquo;And,&rdquo;
      he added, &ldquo;owing to the fact that I started a trifle late in life, I
      believe I could stand a little more of the same.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The door opened and Ricardo looked in on them. &ldquo;Killjoy!&rdquo;
      Webster growled. &ldquo;Old Killjoy the Thirteenth, King of Sobrante. Is
      this a surprise to you?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not a bit of it, Jack. I knew it was due.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Am I welcome in the Ruey family?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Ricardo came over and kissed his sister. &ldquo;Don't be a lobster,
      Jack,&rdquo; he protested. &ldquo;I dislike foolish questions.&rdquo; And
      he pressed his friend's hand with a fervour that testified to his
      pleasure.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm sorry to crowd in at a time like this, Jack,&rdquo; he
      continued, with a hug for Dolores, &ldquo;but Mr. What-you-may-call-him,
      the American consul, has called to pay his respects. As a fellow-citizen
      of yours, he is vitally interested in your welfare. Would you care to
      receive him for a few minutes?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;One minute will do,&rdquo; Webster declared with emphasis. &ldquo;Show
      the human slug up, Rick.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Lemuel Tolliver tripped breezily in with outstretched hand. &ldquo;My
      dear Mr. Webster,&rdquo; he began, but Webster cut him short with a
      peremptory gesture.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Listen, friend Tolliver,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;The only reason I
      received you was to tell you I'm going to remain in this country
      awhile and help develop it. I may even conclude to grow up with it. I
      shall not, of course, renounce my American citizenship; and of course, as
      an American citizen, I am naturally interested in the man my country sends
      to Sobrante to represent it. I might as well be frank and tell you that
      you won't do. I called on you once to do your duty, and you weren't
      there; I told you then I might have something to say about your job later
      on, and now I'm due to say it. Mr. Tolliver, I'm the power
      behind the throne in this little Jim-crow country, and to quote your own
      elegant phraseology, you, as American consul, are <i>nux vomica</i> to the
      Sobrantean government. Moreover, as soon as the Sobrantean ambassador
      reaches Washington, he's going to tell the President that you are,
      and then the President will be courteous enough to remove you. In the
      meantime, fare thee well, Mr. Consul.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But, Mr. Webster&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>Vaya!</i>&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Tolliver, appreciating the utter futility of argument, bowed and
      departed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Verily, life grows sweeter with each passing day,&rdquo; Webster
      murmured whimsically. &ldquo;Rick, old man, I think you had better escort
      the Consul to the front door. Your presence is <i>nux vomica</i> to me
      also. See that you back me up and dispose of that fellow Tolliver, or you
      can't come to our wedding&mdash;can he, sweetheart?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      When Ricardo had taken his departure, laughing, John Stuart Webster looked
      up quite seriously at his wife-to-be. &ldquo;Can you explain to me,
      Dolores,&rdquo; he asked, &ldquo;how it happened that your relatives and
      your father's old friends here in Sobrante, whom you met shortly
      after your arrival, never informed you that Ricardo was living?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They didn't know any more about him than I did, and he left
      here as a mere boy. He was scarcely acquainted with his relatives, all of
      whom bowed quite submissively to the Sarros yoke. Indeed, my father's
      half-brother, Antonio Ruey, actually accepted a portfolio under the Sarros
      régime and held it up to his death. Ricardo has a wholesome contempt for
      his relatives, and as for his father's old friends, none of them
      knew anything about his plans. Apparently his identity was known only to
      the Sarros intelligence bureau, and it did not permit the information to
      leak out.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Funny mix-up,&rdquo; he commented. &ldquo;And by the way, where did
      you get all the inside dope about Neddy Jerome?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      She laughed and related to him the details of Neddy's perfidy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you actually agreed to deliver me, hog-tied and helpless to
      that old schemer, Dolores?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why not, dear. I loved you; I always meant to marry you, if you'd
      let me; and ten thousand dollars would have lasted me for pin money a long
      time.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, you and Neddy have both lost out. Better send the old pelican
      a cable and wake him out of his day-dream.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I sent the cable yesterday, John dear.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Extraordinary woman!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I've just received an answer. Neddy has spent nearly fifty
      dollars telling me by cable what a fine man you are and how thankful I
      ought to be to the good Lord for permitting you to marry me.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dolores, you are perfectly amazing. I only proposed to you a minute
      ago.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know you did, slow-poke, but that is not your fault. You would
      have proposed to me yesterday, only I thought best not to disturb you
      until you were a little stronger. This evening, however, I made up my mind
      to settle the matter, and so I&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But suppose I hadn't proposed to you, after all?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then, John, I should have proposed to you, I fear.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you were running an awful risk, sending that telegram to Neddy
      Jerome.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      She took one large red ear in each little hand and shook his head
      lovingly. &ldquo;Silly,&rdquo; she whispered, &ldquo;don't be a
      goose. I knew you loved me; I would have known it, even if Neddy Jerome
      hadn't told me so. So I played a safe game all the way through, and
      oh, dear Caliph John, I'm so happy I could cry.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;God bless my mildewed soul,&rdquo; John Stuart Webster murmured
      helplessly. The entire matter was quite beyond his comprehension!
    </p>

of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project

phrase &ldquo;Project Gutenberg&rdquo; is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it

  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase &ldquo;Project

  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, &ldquo;Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation.&rdquo;

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain &ldquo;Defects,&rdquo; such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the &ldquo;Right
of Replacement or Refund&rdquo; described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
